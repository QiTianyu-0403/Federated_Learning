s?

PANDARUS:
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
upon him, for my business seethes.

Servant:
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!

PANDARUS:
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!

HELEN:
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.

PANDARUS:
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
prince, here is good broken music.

PARIS:
You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
of harmony.

PANDARUS:
Truly, lady, no.

HELEN:
O, sir,--

PANDARUS:
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

PARIS:
Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.

PANDARUS:
I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
will you vouchsafe me a word?

HELEN:
Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
sing, certainly.

PANDARUS:
Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
friend, your brother Troilus,--

HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--

PANDARUS:
Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
affectionately to you,--

HELEN:
You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
our melancholy upon your head!

PANDARUS:
Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.

HELEN:
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.

PANDARUS:
Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,
in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,
no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.

HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus,--

PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?

PARIS:
What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?

HELEN:
Nay, but, my lord,--

PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
with you. You must not know where he sups.

PARIS:
I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.

PANDARUS:
No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your
disposer is sick.

PARIS:
Well, I'll make excuse.

PANDARUS:
Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
your poor disposer's sick.

PARIS:
I spy.

PANDARUS:
You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
instrument. Now, sweet queen.

HELEN:
Why, this is kindly done.

PANDARUS:
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
sweet queen.

HELEN:
She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.

PANDARUS:
He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.

HELEN:
Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.

PANDARUS:
Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
you a song now.

HELEN:
Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
hast a fine forehead.

PANDARUS:
Ay, you may, you may.

HELEN:
Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!

PANDARUS:
Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.

PARIS:
Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.

PANDARUS:
In good troth, it begins so.
Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
For, O, love's bow
Shoots buck and doe:
The shaft confounds,
Not that it wounds,
But tickles still the sore.
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
So dying love lives still:
Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
Heigh-ho!

HELEN:
In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.

PARIS:
He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.

PANDARUS:
Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:
is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
a-field to-day?

PARIS:
Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,
but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
brother Troilus went not?

HELEN:
He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.

PANDARUS:
Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?

PARIS:
To a hair.

PANDARUS:
Farewell, sweet queen.

HELEN:
Commend me to your niece.

PANDARUS:
I will, sweet queen.

PARIS:
They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.

HELEN:
'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
Yea, overshines ourself.

PARIS:
Sweet, above thought I love thee.

PANDARUS:
How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
Cressida's?

Boy:
No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.

PANDARUS:
O, here he comes.
How now, how now!

TROILUS:
Sirrah, walk off.

PANDARUS:
Have you seen my cousin?

TROILUS:
No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
And give me swift transportance to those fields
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
And fly with me to Cressid!

PANDARUS:
Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.

TROILUS:
I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
The imaginary relish is so sweet
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
When that the watery palate tastes indeed
Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
For the capacity of my ruder powers:
I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying.

PANDARUS:
She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
new-ta'en sparrow.

TROILUS:
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
Like vassalage at unawares encountering
The eye of majesty.

PANDARUS:
Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,
we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air
is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
ducks i' the river: go to, go to.

TROILUS:
You have bereft me of all words, lady.

PANDARUS:
Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.

CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?

TROILUS:
O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!

CRESSIDA:
Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!

TROILUS:
What should they grant? what makes this pretty
abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
lady in the fountain of our love?

CRESSIDA:
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.

TROILUS:
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.

CRESSIDA:
Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
fear the worst oft cures the worse.

TROILUS:
O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
pageant there is presented no monster.

CRESSIDA:
Nor nothing monstrous neither?

TROILUS:
Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep
seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
is infinite and the execution confined, that the
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.

CRESSIDA:
They say all lovers swear more performance than they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
are they not monsters?

TROILUS:
Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present: we will not name
desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
speak truest not truer than Troilus.

CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?

PANDARUS:
What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?

CRESSIDA:
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.

PANDARUS:
I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
flinch, chide me for it.

TROILUS:
You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my
firm faith.

PANDARUS:
Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
they'll stick where they are thrown.

CRESSIDA:
Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
For many weary months.

TROILUS:
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?

CRESSIDA:
Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
I love you now; but not, till now, so much
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

TROILUS:
And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.

PANDARUS:
Pretty, i' faith.

CRESSIDA:
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

TROILUS:
Your leave, sweet Cressid!

PANDARUS:
Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--

CRESSIDA:
Pray you, content you.

TROILUS:
What offends you, lady?

CRESSIDA:
Sir, mine own company.

TROILUS:
You cannot shun Yourself.

CRESSIDA:
Let me go and try:
I have a kind of self resides with you;
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
To be another's fool. I would be gone:
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

TROILUS:
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.

CRESSIDA:
Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
And fell so roundly to a large confession,
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.

TROILUS:
O that I thought it could be in a woman--
As, if it can, I will presume in you--
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
I am as true as truth's simplicity
And simpler than the infancy of truth.

CRESSIDA:
In that I'll war with you.

TROILUS:
O virtuous fight,
When right with right wars who shall be most right!
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
As truth's authentic author to be cited,
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
And sanctify the numbers.

CRESSIDA:
Prophet may you be!
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
When time is old and hath forgot itself,
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
And mighty states characterless are grated
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
From false to false, among false maids in love,
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
'As false as Cressid.'

PANDARUS:
Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
taken such pains to bring you together, let all
pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.

TROILUS:
Amen.

CRESSIDA:
Amen.

PANDARUS:
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!

CALCHAS:
Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
From certain and possess'd conveniences,
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
And here, to do you service, am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit,
Out of those many register'd in promise,
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

AGAMEMNON:
What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.

CALCHAS:
You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack,
Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
In most accepted pain.

AGAMEMNON:
Let Diomedes bear him,
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.

DIOMEDES:
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.

ULYSSES:
Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
If so, I have derision medicinable,
To use between your strangeness and his pride,
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
It may be good: pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride, for supple knees
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.

AGAMEMNON:
We'll execute your purpose, and put on
A form of strangeness as we pass along:
So do each lord, and either greet him not,
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.

ACHILLES:
What, comes the general to speak with me?
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

AGAMEMNON:
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?

NESTOR:
Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

ACHILLES:
No.

NESTOR:
Nothing, my lord.

AGAMEMNON:
The better.

ACHILLES:
Good day, good day.

MENELAUS:
How do you? how do you?

ACHILLES:
What, does the cuckold scorn me?

AJAX:
How now, Patroclus!

ACHILLES:
Good morrow, Ajax.

AJAX:
Ha?

ACHILLES:
Good morrow.

AJAX:
Ay, and good next day too.

ACHILLES:
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

PATROCLUS:
They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
To come as humbly as they used to creep
To holy altars.

ACHILLES:
What, am I poor of late?
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
And not a man, for being simply man,
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
Do one pluck down another and together
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess,
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
I'll interrupt his reading.
How now Ulysses!

ULYSSES:
Now, great Thetis' son!

ACHILLES:
What are you reading?

ULYSSES:
A strange fellow here
Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
How much in having, or without or in,
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver.'

ACHILLES:
This is not strange, Ulysses.
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not, but commends itself
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
Salutes each other with each other's form;
For speculation turns not to itself,
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

ULYSSES:
I do not strain at the position,--
It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
That no man is the lord of any thing,
Though in and of him there be much consisting,
Till he communicate his parts to others:
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them form'd in the applause
Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
reverberates
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;
And apprehended here immediately
The unknown Ajax.
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
While some men leave to do!
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
How one man eats into another's pride,
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
And great Troy shrieking.

ACHILLES:
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?

ULYSSES:
Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: if you give way,
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
And leave you hindmost;
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;
For beauty, wit,
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
To envious and calumniating time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
And give to dust that is a little gilt
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object.
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
And still it might, and yet it may again,
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
And drave great Mars to faction.

ACHILLES:
Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons.

ULYSSES:
But 'gainst your privacy
The reasons are more potent and heroical:
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
With one of Priam's daughters.

ACHILLES:
Ha! known!

ULYSSES:
Is that a wonder?
The providence that's in a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
There is a mystery--with whom relation
Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.

PATROCLUS:
To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus:
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
Be shook to air.

ACHILLES:
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

PATROCLUS:
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.

ACHILLES:
I see my reputation is at stake
My fame is shrewdly gored.

PATROCLUS:
O, then, beware;
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.

ACHILLES:
Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
An appetite that I am sick withal,
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
To talk with him and to behold his visage,
Even to my full of view.
A labour saved!

THERSITES:
A wonder!

ACHILLES:
What?

THERSITES:
Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

ACHILLES:
How so?

THERSITES:
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing.

ACHILLES:
How can that be?

THERSITES:
Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
sides, like a leather jerkin.

ACHILLES:
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

THERSITES:
Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
pageant of Ajax.

ACHILLES:
To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
et cetera. Do this.

PATROCLUS:
Jove bless great Ajax!

THERSITES:
Hum!

PATROCLUS:
I come from the worthy Achilles,--

THERSITES:
Ha!

PATROCLUS:
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--

THERSITES:
Hum!

PATROCLUS:
And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

THERSITES:
Agamemnon!

PATROCLUS:
Ay, my lord.

THERSITES:
Ha!

PATROCLUS:
What say you to't?

THERSITES:
God b' wi' you, with all my heart.

PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.

THERSITES:
If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
ere he has me.

PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.

THERSITES:
Fare you well, with all my heart.

ACHILLES:
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

THERSITES:
No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
get his sinews to make catlings on.

ACHILLES:
Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

THERSITES:
Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
capable creature.

ACHILLES:
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
And I myself see not the bottom of it.

THERSITES:
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

PARIS:
See, ho! who is that there?

DEIPHOBUS:
It is the Lord AEneas.

AENEAS:
Is the prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.

DIOMEDES:
That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.

PARIS:
A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
Witness the process of your speech, wherein
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
Did haunt you in the field.

AENEAS:
Health to you, valiant sir,
During all question of the gentle truce;
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute.

DIOMEDES:
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit and policy.

AENEAS:
And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill more excellently.

DIOMEDES:
We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!

AENEAS:
We know each other well.

DIOMEDES:
We do; and long to know each other worse.

PARIS:
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
What business, lord, so early?

AENEAS:
I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.

PARIS:
His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
Let's have your company, or, if you please,
Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
We shall be much unwelcome.

AENEAS:
That I assure you:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy.

PARIS:
There is no help;
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.

AENEAS:
Good morrow, all.

PARIS:
And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
Myself or Menelaus?

DIOMEDES:
Both alike:
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.

PARIS:
You are too bitter to your countrywoman.

DIOMEDES:
She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight,
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.

PARIS:
Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
But we in silence hold this virtue well,
We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
Here lies our way.

TROILUS:
Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.

CRESSIDA:
Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
He shall unbolt the gates.

TROILUS:
Trouble him not;
To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
As infants' empty of all thought!

CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, then.

TROILUS:
I prithee now, to bed.

CRESSIDA:
Are you a-weary of me?

TROILUS:
O Cressida! but that the busy day,
Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
I would not from thee.

CRESSIDA:
Night hath been too brief.

TROILUS:
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
You will catch cold, and curse me.

CRESSIDA:
Prithee, tarry:
You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
And then you would have tarried. Hark!
there's one up.

PANDARUS:

TROILUS:
It is your uncle.

CRESSIDA:
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
I shall have such a life!

PANDARUS:
How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
maid! where's my cousin Cressid?

CRESSIDA:
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.

PANDARUS:
To do what? to do what? let her say
what: what have I brought you to do?

CRESSIDA:
Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
Nor suffer others.

PANDARUS:
Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!

CRESSIDA:
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
My lord, come you again into my chamber:
You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.

TROILUS:
Ha, ha!

CRESSIDA:
Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.

PANDARUS:
Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
down the door? How now! what's the matter?

AENEAS:
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.

PANDARUS:
Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
I knew you not: what news with you so early?

AENEAS:
Is not Prince Troilus here?

PANDARUS:
Here! what should he do here?

AENEAS:
Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
It doth import him much to speak with me.

PANDARUS:
Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
should he do here?

AENEAS:
Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
fetch him hither; go.

TROILUS:
How now! what's the matter?

AENEAS:
My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
My matter is so rash: there is at hand
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
We must give up to Diomedes' hand
The Lady Cressida.

TROILUS:
Is it so concluded?

AENEAS:
By Priam and the general state of Troy:
They are at hand and ready to effect it.

TROILUS:
How my achievements mock me!
I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
We met by chance; you did not find me here.

AENEAS:
Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
Have not more gift in taciturnity.

PANDARUS:
Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!

CRESSIDA:
How now! what's the matter? who was here?

PANDARUS:
Ah, ah!

CRESSIDA:
Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?

PANDARUS:
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!

CRESSIDA:
O the gods! what's the matter?

PANDARUS:
Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!

CRESSIDA:
Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
what's the matter?

PANDARUS:
Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.

CRESSIDA:
O you immortal gods! I will not go.

PANDARUS:
Thou must.

CRESSIDA:
I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
I know no touch of consanguinity;
No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
Do to this body what extremes you can;
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth,
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--

PANDARUS:
Do, do.

CRESSIDA:
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.

PARIS:
It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
Tell you the lady what she is to do,
And haste her to the purpose.

TROILUS:
Walk into her house;
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
And to his hand when I deliver her,
Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
A priest there offering to it his own heart.

PARIS:
I know what 'tis to love;
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
Please you walk in, my lords.

PANDARUS:
Be moderate, be moderate.

CRESSIDA:
Why tell you me of moderation?
The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
And violenteth in a sense as strong
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
If I could temporize with my affection,
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
The like allayment could I give my grief.
My love admits no qualifying dross;
No more my grief, in such a precious loss.

PANDARUS:
Here, here, here he comes.
Ah, sweet ducks!

CRESSIDA:
O Troilus! Troilus!

PANDARUS:
What a pair of spectacles is here!
Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
'--O heart, heavy heart,
Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
where he answers again,
'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
By friendship nor by speaking.'
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?

TROILUS:
Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.

CRESSIDA:
Have the gods envy?

PANDARUS:
Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.

CRESSIDA:
And is it true that I must go from Troy?

TROILUS:
A hateful truth.

CRESSIDA:
What, and from Troilus too?

TROILUS:
From Troy and Troilus.

CRESSIDA:
Is it possible?

TROILUS:
And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
We two, that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.

AENEAS:

TROILUS:
Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.

PANDARUS:
Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
my heart will be blown up by the root.

CRESSIDA:
I must then to the Grecians?

TROILUS:
No remedy.

CRESSIDA:
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?

TROILUS:
Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--

CRESSIDA:
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?

TROILUS:
Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
For it is parting from us:
I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
That there's no maculation in thy heart:
But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
My sequent protestation; be thou true,
And I will see thee.

CRESSIDA:
O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.

TROILUS:
And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.

CRESSIDA:
And you this glove. When shall I see you?

TROILUS:
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
To give thee nightly visitation.
But yet be true.

CRESSIDA:
O heavens! 'be true' again!

TROILUS:
Hear while I speak it, love:
The Grecian youths are full of quality;
They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
How novelty may move, and parts with person,
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
Makes me afeard.

CRESSIDA:
O heavens! you love me not.

TROILUS:
Die I a villain, then!
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
But I can tell that in each grace of these
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.

CRESSIDA:
Do you think I will?

TROILUS:
No.
But something may be done that we will not:
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
Presuming on their changeful potency.

AENEAS:

TROILUS:
Come, kiss; and let us part.

PARIS:

TROILUS:
Good brother, come you hither;
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.

CRESSIDA:
My lord, will you be true?

TROILUS:
Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
Which for Antenor we deliver you:
At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
And by the way possess thee what she is.
Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilion.

DIOMEDES:
Fair Lady Cressid,
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.

TROILUS:
Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
I'll cut thy throat.

DIOMEDES:
O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
Let me be privileged by my place and message,
To be a speaker free; when I am hence
I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'

TROILUS:
Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.

PARIS:
Hark! Hector's trumpet.

AENEAS:
How have we spent this morning!
The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
That sore to ride before him to the field.

PARIS:
'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.

DEIPHOBUS:
Let us make ready straight.

AENEAS:
Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry.

AGAMEMNON:
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him hither.

AJAX:
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
Thou blow'st for Hector.

ULYSSES:
No trumpet answers.

ACHILLES:
'Tis but early days.

AGAMEMNON:
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?

ULYSSES:
'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.

AGAMEMNON:
Is this the Lady Cressid?

DIOMEDES:
Even she.

AGAMEMNON:
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.

NESTOR:
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.

ULYSSES:
Yet is the kindness but particular;
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.

NESTOR:
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.

ACHILLES:
I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
Achilles bids you welcome.

MENELAUS:
I had good argument for kissing once.

PATROCLUS:
But that's no argument for kissing now;
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
And parted thus you and your argument.

ULYSSES:
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.

PATROCLUS:
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
Patroclus kisses you.

MENELAUS:
O, this is trim!

PATROCLUS:
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.

MENELAUS:
I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.

CRESSIDA:
In kissing, do you render or receive?

PATROCLUS:
Both take and give.

CRESSIDA:
I'll make my match to live,
The kiss you take is better than you give;
Therefore no kiss.

MENELAUS:
I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.

CRESSIDA:
You're an odd man; give even or give none.

MENELAUS:
An odd man, lady! every man is odd.

CRESSIDA:
No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
That you are odd, and he is even with you.

MENELAUS:
You fillip me o' the head.

CRESSIDA:
No, I'll be sworn.

ULYSSES:
It were no match, your nail against his horn.
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?

CRESSIDA:
You may.

ULYSSES:
I do desire it.

CRESSIDA:
Why, beg, then.

ULYSSES:
Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
When Helen is a maid again, and his.

CRESSIDA:
I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.

ULYSSES:
Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.

DIOMEDES:
Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.

NESTOR:
A woman of quick sense.

ULYSSES:
Fie, fie upon her!
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.
O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
To every ticklish reader! set them down
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
And daughters of the game.

ALL:
The Trojans' trumpet.

AGAMEMNON:
Yonder comes the troop.

AENEAS:
Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
A victor shall be known? will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other, or shall be divided
By any voice or order of the field?
Hector bade ask.

AGAMEMNON:
Which way would Hector have it?

AENEAS:
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.

ACHILLES:
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
The knight opposed.

AENEAS:
If not Achilles, sir,
What is your name?

ACHILLES:
If not Achilles, nothing.

AENEAS:
Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
In the extremity of great and little,
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
The one almost as infinite as all,
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.

ACHILLES:
A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.

AGAMEMNON:
Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,
So be it; either to the uttermost,
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

ULYSSES:
They are opposed already.

AGAMEMNON:
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?

ULYSSES:
The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love:
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
Even to his inches, and with private soul
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

AGAMEMNON:
They are in action.

NESTOR:
Now, Ajax, hold thine own!

TROILUS:
Hector, thou sleep'st;
Awake thee!

AGAMEMNON:
His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!

DIOMEDES:
You must no more.

AENEAS:
Princes, enough, so please you.

AJAX:
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

DIOMEDES:
As Hector pleases.

HECTOR:
Why, then will I no more:
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Cousin, all honour to thee!

AJAX:
I thank thee, Hector
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death.

HECTOR:
Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.

AENEAS:
There is expectance here from both the sides,
What further you will do.

HECTOR:
We'll answer it;
The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.

AJAX:
If I might in entreaties find success--
As seld I have the chance--I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.

DIOMEDES:
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.

HECTOR:
AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Trojan part;
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.

AJAX:
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

HECTOR:
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size.

AGAMEMNON:
Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy;
But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

HECTOR:
I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.

AGAMEMNON:

MENELAUS:
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.

HECTOR:
Who must we answer?

AENEAS:
The noble Menelaus.

HECTOR:
O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.

MENELAUS:
Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.

HECTOR:
O, pardon; I offend.

NESTOR:
I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
Despising many forfeits and subduements,
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
Not letting it decline on the declined,
That I have said to some my standers by
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.

AENEAS:
'Tis the old Nestor.

HECTOR:
Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.

NESTOR:
I would my arms could match thee in contention,
As they contend with thee in courtesy.

HECTOR:
I would they could.

NESTOR:
Ha!
By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.

ULYSSES:
I wonder now how yonder city stands
When we have here her base and pillar by us.

HECTOR:
I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.

ULYSSES:
Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
Must kiss their own feet.

HECTOR:
I must not believe you:
There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
And that old common arbitrator, Time,
Will one day end it.

ULYSSES:
So to him we leave it.
Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
After the general, I beseech you next
To feast with me and see me at my tent.

ACHILLES:
I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
And quoted joint by joint.

HECTOR:
Is this Achilles?

ACHILLES:
I am Achilles.

HECTOR:
Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.

ACHILLES:
Behold thy fill.

HECTOR:
Nay, I have done already.

ACHILLES:
Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.

HECTOR:
O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?

ACHILLES:
Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!

HECTOR:
It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
To answer such a question: stand again:
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Where thou wilt hit me dead?

ACHILLES:
I tell thee, yea.

HECTOR:
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
His insolence draws folly from my lips;
But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
Or may I never--

AJAX:
Do not chafe thee, cousin:
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
You may have every day enough of Hector
If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.

HECTOR:
I pray you, let us see you in the field:
We have had pelting wars, since you refused
The Grecians' cause.

ACHILLES:
Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
To-night all friends.

HECTOR:
Thy hand upon that match.

AGAMEMNON:
First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
There in the full convive we: afterwards,
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
That this great soldier may his welcome know.

TROILUS:
My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?

ULYSSES:
At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
On the fair Cressid.

TROILUS:
Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
To bring me thither?

ULYSSES:
You shall command me, sir.
As gentle tell me, of what honour was
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
That wails her absence?

TROILUS:
O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.

ACHILLES:
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.

PATROCLUS:
Here comes Thersites.

ACHILLES:
How now, thou core of envy!
Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?

THERSITES:
Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.

ACHILLES:
From whence, fragment?

THERSITES:
Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.

PATROCLUS:
Who keeps the tent now?

THERSITES:
The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.

PATROCLUS:
Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?

THERSITES:
Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:
thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.

PATROCLUS:
Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?

THERSITES:
Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
again such preposterous discoveries!

PATROCLUS:
Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
thou to curse thus?

THERSITES:
Do I curse thee?

PATROCLUS:
Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
indistinguishable cur, no.

THERSITES:
No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!

PATROCLUS:
Out, gall!

THERSITES:
Finch-egg!

ACHILLES:
My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
This night in banqueting must all be spent.
Away, Patroclus!

THERSITES:
With too much blood and too little brain, these two
may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
spirits and fires!

AGAMEMNON:
We go wrong, we go wrong.

AJAX:
No, yonder 'tis;
There, where we see the lights.

HECTOR:
I trouble you.

AJAX:
No, not a whit.

ULYSSES:
Here comes himself to guide you.

ACHILLES:
Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.

AGAMEMNON:
So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.

HECTOR:
Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.

MENELAUS:
Good night, my lord.

HECTOR:
Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.

THERSITES:
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
sweet sewer.

ACHILLES:
Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
That go or tarry.

AGAMEMNON:
Good night.

ACHILLES:
Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
Keep Hector company an hour or two.

DIOMEDES:
I cannot, lord; I have important business,
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.

HECTOR:
Give me your hand.

ULYSSES:

TROILUS:
Sweet sir, you honour me.

HECTOR:
And so, good night.

ACHILLES:
Come, come, enter my tent.

THERSITES:
That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!

DIOMEDES:
What, are you up here, ho? speak.

CALCHAS:

DIOMEDES:
Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?

CALCHAS:

ULYSSES:
Stand where the torch may not discover us.

TROILUS:
Cressid comes forth to him.

DIOMEDES:
How now, my charge!

CRESSIDA:
Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.

TROILUS:
Yea, so familiar!

ULYSSES:
She will sing any man at first sight.

THERSITES:
And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
she's noted.

DIOMEDES:
Will you remember?

CRESSIDA:
Remember! yes.

DIOMEDES:
Nay, but do, then;
And let your mind be coupled with your words.

TROILUS:
What should she remember?

ULYSSES:
List.

CRESSIDA:
Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.

THERSITES:
Roguery!

DIOMEDES:
Nay, then,--

CRESSIDA:
I'll tell you what,--

DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?

THERSITES:
A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.

DIOMEDES:
What did you swear you would bestow on me?

CRESSIDA:
I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.

DIOMEDES:
Good night.

TROILUS:
Hold, patience!

ULYSSES:
How now, Trojan!

CRESSIDA:
Diomed,--

DIOMEDES:
No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.

TROILUS:
Thy better must.

CRESSIDA:
Hark, one word in your ear.

TROILUS:
O plague and madness!

ULYSSES:
You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.

TROILUS:
Behold, I pray you!

ULYSSES:
Nay, good my lord, go off:
You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.

TROILUS:
I pray thee, stay.

ULYSSES:
You have not patience; come.

TROILUS:
I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
I will not speak a word!

DIOMEDES:
And so, good night.

CRESSIDA:
Nay, but you part in anger.

TROILUS:
Doth that grieve thee?
O wither'd truth!

ULYSSES:
Why, how now, lord!

TROILUS:
By Jove,
I will be patient.

CRESSIDA:
Guardian!--why, Greek!

DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I do not: come hither once again.

ULYSSES:
You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
You will break out.

TROILUS:
She strokes his cheek!

ULYSSES:
Come, come.

TROILUS:
Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
There is between my will and all offences
A guard of patience: stay a little while.

THERSITES:
How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!

DIOMEDES:
But will you, then?

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.

DIOMEDES:
Give me some token for the surety of it.

CRESSIDA:
I'll fetch you one.

ULYSSES:
You have sworn patience.

TROILUS:
Fear me not, sweet lord;
I will not be myself, nor have cognition
Of what I feel: I am all patience.

THERSITES:
Now the pledge; now, now, now!

CRESSIDA:
Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.

TROILUS:
O beauty! where is thy faith?

ULYSSES:
My lord,--

TROILUS:
I will be patient; outwardly I will.

CRESSIDA:
You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.

DIOMEDES:
Whose was't?

CRESSIDA:
It is no matter, now I have't again.
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.

THERSITES:
Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!

DIOMEDES:
I shall have it.

CRESSIDA:
What, this?

DIOMEDES:
Ay, that.

CRESSIDA:
O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.

DIOMEDES:
I had your heart before, this follows it.

TROILUS:
I did swear patience.

CRESSIDA:
You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
I'll give you something else.

DIOMEDES:
I will have this: whose was it?

CRESSIDA:
It is no matter.

DIOMEDES:
Come, tell me whose it was.

CRESSIDA:
'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
But, now you have it, take it.

DIOMEDES:
Whose was it?

CRESSIDA:
By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.

DIOMEDES:
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.

TROILUS:
Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
It should be challenged.

CRESSIDA:
Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
I will not keep my word.

DIOMEDES:
Why, then, farewell;
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.

CRESSIDA:
You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
But it straight starts you.

DIOMEDES:
I do not like this fooling.

THERSITES:
Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.

DIOMEDES:
What, shall I come? the hour?

CRESSIDA:
Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.

DIOMEDES:
Farewell till then.

CRESSIDA:
Good night: I prithee, come.
Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
The error of our eye directs our mind:
What error leads must err; O, then conclude
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.

THERSITES:
A proof of strength she could not publish more,
Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'

ULYSSES:
All's done, my lord.

TROILUS:
It is.

ULYSSES:
Why stay we, then?

TROILUS:
To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke.
But if I tell how these two did co-act,
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
An esperance so obstinately strong,
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
As if those organs had deceptious functions,
Created only to calumniate.
Was Cressid here?

ULYSSES:
I cannot conjure, Trojan.

TROILUS:
She was not, sure.

ULYSSES:
Most sure she was.

TROILUS:
Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.

ULYSSES:
Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.

TROILUS:
Let it not be believed for womanhood!
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
For depravation, to square the general sex
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.

ULYSSES:
What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?

TROILUS:
Nothing at all, unless that this were she.

THERSITES:
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?

TROILUS:
This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
If there be rule in unity itself,
This is not she. O madness of discourse,
That cause sets up with and against itself!
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.

ULYSSES:
May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
With that which here his passion doth express?

TROILUS:
Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
In characters as red as Mars his heart
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Falling on Diomed.

THERSITES:
He'll tickle it for his concupy.

TROILUS:
O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
And they'll seem glorious.

ULYSSES:
O, contain yourself
Your passion draws ears hither.

AENEAS:
I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.

TROILUS:
Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!

ULYSSES:
I'll bring you to the gates.

TROILUS:
Accept distracted thanks.

THERSITES:
Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
Patroclus will give me any thing for the
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!

ANDROMACHE:
When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
To stop his ears against admonishment?
Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.

HECTOR:
You train me to offend you; get you in:
By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!

ANDROMACHE:
My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.

HECTOR:
No more, I say.

CASSANDRA:
Where is my brother Hector?

ANDROMACHE:
Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

CASSANDRA:
O, 'tis true.

HECTOR:
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!

CASSANDRA:
No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.

HECTOR:
Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.

CASSANDRA:
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

ANDROMACHE:
O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
And rob in the behalf of charity.

CASSANDRA:
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
But vows to every purpose must not hold:
Unarm, sweet Hector.

HECTOR:
Hold you still, I say;
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?

ANDROMACHE:
Cassandra, call my father to persuade.

HECTOR:
No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.

TROILUS:
Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
Which better fits a lion than a man.

HECTOR:
What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.

TROILUS:
When many times the captive Grecian falls,
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
You bid them rise, and live.

HECTOR:
O,'tis fair play.

TROILUS:
Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.

HECTOR:
How now! how now!

TROILUS:
For the love of all the gods,
Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
And when we have our armours buckled on,
The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.

HECTOR:
Fie, savage, fie!

TROILUS:
Hector, then 'tis wars.

HECTOR:
Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.

TROILUS:
Who should withhold me?
Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
But by my ruin.

CASSANDRA:
Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
Fall all together.

PRIAM:
Come, Hector, come, go back:
Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous:
Therefore, come back.

HECTOR:
AEneas is a-field;
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
Even in the faith of valour, to appear
This morning to them.

PRIAM:
Ay, but thou shalt not go.

HECTOR:
I must not break my faith.
You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
To take that course by your consent and voice,
Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.

CASSANDRA:
O Priam, yield not to him!

ANDROMACHE:
Do not, dear father.

HECTOR:
Andromache, I am offended with you:
Upon the love you bear me, get you in.

TROILUS:
This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
Makes all these bodements.

CASSANDRA:
O, farewell, dear Hector!
Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
Like witless antics, one another meet,
And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!

TROILUS:
Away! away!

CASSANDRA:
Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.

HECTOR:
You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.

PRIAM:
Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!

TROILUS:
They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.

PANDARUS:
Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?

TROILUS:
What now?

PANDARUS:
Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.

TROILUS:
Let me read.

PANDARUS:
A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;
and what one thing, what another, that I shall
leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
to think on't. What says she there?

TROILUS:
Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:
The effect doth operate another way.
Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
My love with words and errors still she feeds;
But edifies another with her deeds.

THERSITES:
Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.

TROILUS:
Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
I would swim after.

DIOMEDES:
Thou dost miscall retire:
I do not fly, but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
Have at thee!

THERSITES:
Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!

HECTOR:
What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
Art thou of blood and honour?

THERSITES:
No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
a very filthy rogue.

HECTOR:
I do believe thee: live.

THERSITES:
God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
I'll seek them.

DIOMEDES:
Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
And am her knight by proof.

Servant:
I go, my lord.

AGAMEMNON:
Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
Hath Doreus prisoner,
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
Upon the pashed corses of the kings
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
To reinforcement, or we perish all.

NESTOR:
Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
Dexterity so obeying appetite
That what he will he does, and does so much
That proof is call'd impossibility.

ULYSSES:
O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles
Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
Mad and fantastic execution,
Engaging and redeeming of himself
With such a careless force and forceless care
As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
Bade him win all.

AJAX:
Troilus! thou coward Troilus!

DIOMEDES:
Ay, there, there.

NESTOR:
So, so, we draw together.

ACHILLES:
Where is this Hector?
Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;
Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.

AJAX:
Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!

DIOMEDES:
Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?

AJAX:
What wouldst thou?

DIOMEDES:
I would correct him.

AJAX:
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!

TROILUS:
O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!

DIOMEDES:
Ha, art thou there?

AJAX:
I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.

DIOMEDES:
He is my prize; I will not look upon.

TROILUS:
Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!

HECTOR:
Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!

ACHILLES:
Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!

HECTOR:
Pause, if thou wilt.

ACHILLES:
I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
Be happy that my arms are out of use:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.

HECTOR:
Fare thee well:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!

TROILUS:
Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life to-day.

HECTOR:
Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,
beast, abide?
Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.

ACHILLES:
Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
And when I have the bloody Hector found,
Empale him with your weapons round about;
In fellest manner execute your aims.
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
It is decreed Hector the great must die.

THERSITES:
The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,
bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-
henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the
game: ware horns, ho!

MARGARELON:
Turn, slave, and fight.

THERSITES:
What art thou?

MARGARELON:
A bastard son of Priam's.

THERSITES:
I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard
begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:
farewell, bastard.

MARGARELON:
The devil take thee, coward!

HECTOR:
Most putrefied core, so fair without,
Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.

ACHILLES:
Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
To close the day up, Hector's life is done.

HECTOR:
I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.

ACHILLES:
Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.

MYRMIDONS:
The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.

ACHILLES:
The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.

AGAMEMNON:
Hark! hark! what shout is that?

NESTOR:
Peace, drums!
Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.

DIOMEDES:
The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.

AJAX:
If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was a man as good as he.

AGAMEMNON:
March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

AENEAS:
Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
Never go home; here starve we out the night.

TROILUS:
Hector is slain.

ALL:
Hector! the gods forbid!

TROILUS:
He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
And linger not our sure destructions on!

AENEAS:
My lord, you do discomfort all the host!

TROILUS:
You understand me not that tell me so:
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
But dare all imminence that gods and men
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.

PANDARUS:
But hear you, hear you!

TROILUS:
Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!

PANDARUS:
A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
And being once subdued in armed tail,
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
painted cloths.
As many as be here of pander's hall,
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
It should be now, but that my fear is this,
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.

ANTONIO:
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.

SALARINO:
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

SALANIO:
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Would make me sad.

SALARINO:
My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

ANTONIO:
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

SALARINO:
Why, then you are in love.

ANTONIO:
Fie, fie!

SALARINO:
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

SALANIO:
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.

SALARINO:
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.

ANTONIO:
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

SALARINO:
Good morrow, my good lords.

BASSANIO:
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

SALARINO:
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

LORENZO:
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

BASSANIO:
I will not fail you.

GRATIANO:
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.

ANTONIO:
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.

GRATIANO:
Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

LORENZO:
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

GRATIANO:
Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.

ANTONIO:
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

GRATIANO:
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

ANTONIO:
Is that any thing now?

BASSANIO:
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
have them, they are not worth the search.

ANTONIO:
Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

BASSANIO:
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

ANTONIO:
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

BASSANIO:
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

ANTONIO:
You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

BASSANIO:
In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!

ANTONIO:
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.

PORTIA:
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
this great world.

NERISSA:
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.

PORTIA:
Good sentences and well pronounced.

NERISSA:
They would be better, if well followed.

PORTIA:
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

NERISSA:
Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come?

PORTIA:
I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
them, I will describe them; and, according to my
description, level at my affection.

NERISSA:
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.

PORTIA:
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith.

NERISSA:
Then there is the County Palatine.

PORTIA:
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these. God defend me from these
two!

NERISSA:
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?

PORTIA:
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
shall never requite him.

NERISSA:
What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
of England?

PORTIA:
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where.

NERISSA:
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?

PORTIA:
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another.

NERISSA:
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

PORTIA:
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
make shift to go without him.

NERISSA:
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
will, if you should refuse to accept him.

PORTIA:
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.

NERISSA:
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets.

PORTIA:
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
them a fair departure.

NERISSA:
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?

PORTIA:
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.

NERISSA:
True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.

PORTIA:
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
thy praise.
How now! what news?

Servant:
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night.

PORTIA:
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats; well.

BASSANIO:
Ay, sir, for three months.

SHYLOCK:
For three months; well.

BASSANIO:
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

SHYLOCK:
Antonio shall become bound; well.

BASSANIO:
May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
know your answer?

SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.

BASSANIO:
Your answer to that.

SHYLOCK:
Antonio is a good man.

BASSANIO:
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

SHYLOCK:
Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
take his bond.

BASSANIO:
Be assured you may.

SHYLOCK:
I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?

BASSANIO:
If it please you to dine with us.

SHYLOCK:
Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?

BASSANIO:
This is Signior Antonio.

SHYLOCK:

BASSANIO:
Shylock, do you hear?

SHYLOCK:
I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire?
Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

ANTONIO:
Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

SHYLOCK:
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

ANTONIO:
And for three months.

SHYLOCK:
I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.

ANTONIO:
I do never use it.

SHYLOCK:
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

ANTONIO:
And what of him? did he take interest?

SHYLOCK:
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

ANTONIO:
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

SHYLOCK:
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.

ANTONIO:
Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--

ANTONIO:
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

SHYLOCK:
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

ANTONIO:
I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.

SHYLOCK:
Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.

BASSANIO:
This were kindness.

SHYLOCK:
This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

ANTONIO:
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

BASSANIO:
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

ANTONIO:
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

SHYLOCK:
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

ANTONIO:
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

SHYLOCK:
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.

ANTONIO:
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

BASSANIO:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

ANTONIO:
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.

MOROCCO:
Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

PORTIA:
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.

MOROCCO:
Even for that I thank you:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.

PORTIA:
You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

MOROCCO:
Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.

PORTIA:
First, forward to the temple: after dinner
Your hazard shall be made.

MOROCCO:
Good fortune then!
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.

LAUNCELOT:
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
indeed, my father did something smack, something
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
at your command; I will run.

GOBBO:
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
to master Jew's?

LAUNCELOT:

GOBBO:
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
to master Jew's?

LAUNCELOT:
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
down indirectly to the Jew's house.

GOBBO:
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
you tell me whether one Launcelot,
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

LAUNCELOT:
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
of young Master Launcelot?

GOBBO:
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
and, God be thanked, well to live.

LAUNCELOT:
Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
young Master Launcelot.

GOBBO:
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.

LAUNCELOT:
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
talk you of young Master Launcelot?

GOBBO:
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.

LAUNCELOT:
Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
in plain terms, gone to heaven.

GOBBO:
Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
age, my very prop.

LAUNCELOT:
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
a prop? Do you know me, father?

GOBBO:
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
soul, alive or dead?

LAUNCELOT:
Do you not know me, father?

GOBBO:
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.

LAUNCELOT:
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
may, but at the length truth will out.

GOBBO:
Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
Launcelot, my boy.

LAUNCELOT:
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
that was, your son that is, your child that shall
be.

GOBBO:
I cannot think you are my son.

LAUNCELOT:
I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
wife is my mother.

GOBBO:
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

LAUNCELOT:
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
than I have of my face when I last saw him.

GOBBO:
Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
master agree? I have brought him a present. How
'gree you now?

LAUNCELOT:
Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have with
my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.

BASSANIO:
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

LAUNCELOT:
To him, father.

GOBBO:
God bless your worship!

BASSANIO:
Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?

GOBBO:
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--

LAUNCELOT:
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
would, sir, as my father shall specify--

GOBBO:
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--

LAUNCELOT:
Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
and have a desire, as my father shall specify--

GOBBO:
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
are scarce cater-cousins--

LAUNCELOT:
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

GOBBO:
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
your worship, and my suit is--

LAUNCELOT:
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.

BASSANIO:
One speak for both. What would you?

LAUNCELOT:
Serve you, sir.

GOBBO:
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

BASSANIO:
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

LAUNCELOT:
The old proverb is very well parted between my
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
God, sir, and he hath enough.

BASSANIO:
Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out. Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

LAUNCELOT:
Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.

BASSANIO:
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

LEONARDO:
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

GRATIANO:
Where is your master?

LEONARDO:
Yonder, sir, he walks.

GRATIANO:
Signior Bassanio!

BASSANIO:
Gratiano!

GRATIANO:
I have a suit to you.

BASSANIO:
You have obtain'd it.

GRATIANO:
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.

BASSANIO:
Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.

GRATIANO:
Signior Bassanio, hear me:
If I do not put on a sober habit,
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
Use all the observance of civility,
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam, never trust me more.

BASSANIO:
Well, we shall see your bearing.

GRATIANO:
Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
By what we do to-night.

BASSANIO:
No, that were pity:
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
I have some business.

GRATIANO:
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
But we will visit you at supper-time.

JESSICA:
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
Give him this letter; do it secretly;
And so farewell: I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.

LAUNCELOT:
Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit: adieu.

JESSICA:
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

LORENZO:
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.

GRATIANO:
We have not made good preparation.

SALARINO:
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

SALANIO:
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
And better in my mind not undertook.

LORENZO:
'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us.
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

LAUNCELOT:
An it shall please you to break up
this, it shall seem to signify.

LORENZO:
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.

GRATIANO:
Love-news, in faith.

LAUNCELOT:
By your leave, sir.

LORENZO:
Whither goest thou?

LAUNCELOT:
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.

LORENZO:
Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.

SALANIO:
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

SALANIO:
And so will I.

LORENZO:
Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.

SALARINO:
'Tis good we do so.

GRATIANO:
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

LORENZO:
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

SHYLOCK:
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
Why, Jessica, I say!

LAUNCELOT:
Why, Jessica!

SHYLOCK:
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

LAUNCELOT:
Your worship was wont to tell me that
I could do nothing without bidding.

JESSICA:
Call you? what is your will?

SHYLOCK:
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

LAUNCELOT:
I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
your reproach.

SHYLOCK:
So do I his.

LAUNCELOT:
An they have conspired together, I will not say you
shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
year, in the afternoon.

SHYLOCK:
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
Say I will come.

LAUNCELOT:
I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
window, for all this, There will come a Christian
boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

SHYLOCK:
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?

JESSICA:
His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.

SHYLOCK:
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that would have him help to waste
His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps I will return immediately:
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
Fast bind, fast find;
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

JESSICA:
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

GRATIANO:
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.

SALARINO:
His hour is almost past.

GRATIANO:
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.

SALARINO:
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

GRATIANO:
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like the prodigal doth she return,
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

SALARINO:
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

LORENZO:
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?

JESSICA:
Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

LORENZO:
Lorenzo, and thy love.

JESSICA:
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

LORENZO:
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

JESSICA:
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

LORENZO:
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

JESSICA:
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.

LORENZO:
So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

JESSICA:
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

GRATIANO:
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

LORENZO:
Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

ANTONIO:
Who's there?

GRATIANO:
Signior Antonio!

ANTONIO:
Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

GRATIANO:
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

PORTIA:
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.

MOROCCO:
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
The second, silver, which this promise carries,
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

PORTIA:
The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

MOROCCO:
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

PORTIA:
There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours.

MOROCCO:
O hell! what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

PORTIA:
A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

SALARINO:
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
With him is Gratiano gone along;
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

SALANIO:
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

SALARINO:
He came too late, the ship was under sail:
But there the duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

SALANIO:
I never heard a passion so confused,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

SALARINO:
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.

SALANIO:
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.

SALARINO:
Marry, well remember'd.
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
The French and English, there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

SALANIO:
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

SALARINO:
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

SALANIO:
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other.

SALARINO:
Do we so.

NERISSA:
Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.

PORTIA:
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.

ARRAGON:
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

PORTIA:
To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

ARRAGON:
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

PORTIA:
Too long a pause for that which you find there.

ARRAGON:
What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

PORTIA:
To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
And of opposed natures.

ARRAGON:
What is here?
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is,
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.

PORTIA:
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

NERISSA:
The ancient saying is no heresy,
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

PORTIA:
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

Servant:
Where is my lady?

PORTIA:
Here: what would my lord?

Servant:
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before
To signify the approaching of his lord;
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love:
A day in April never came so sweet,
To show how costly summer was at hand,
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

PORTIA:
No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

NERISSA:
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

SALANIO:
Now, what news on the Rialto?

SALARINO:
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
Report be an honest woman of her word.

SALANIO:
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
to keep his name company!--

SALARINO:
Come, the full stop.

SALANIO:
Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
lost a ship.

SALARINO:
I would it might prove the end of his losses.

SALANIO:
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?

SHYLOCK:
You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
daughter's flight.

SALARINO:
That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal.

SALANIO:
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.

SHYLOCK:
She is damned for it.

SALANIO:
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.

SHYLOCK:
My own flesh and blood to rebel!

SALANIO:
Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?

SHYLOCK:
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

SALARINO:
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
loss at sea or no?

SHYLOCK:
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
look to his bond.

SALARINO:
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
his flesh: what's that good for?

SHYLOCK:
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.

Servant:
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
desires to speak with you both.

SALARINO:
We have been up and down to seek him.

SALANIO:
Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.

SHYLOCK:
How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
found my daughter?

TUBAL:
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.

SHYLOCK:
Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
but of my shedding.

TUBAL:
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
heard in Genoa,--

SHYLOCK:
What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?

TUBAL:
Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.

SHYLOCK:
I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?

TUBAL:
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.

SHYLOCK:
I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
ha, ha! where? in Genoa?

TUBAL:
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
night fourscore ducats.

SHYLOCK:
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
fourscore ducats!

TUBAL:
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.

SHYLOCK:
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
him: I am glad of it.

TUBAL:
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey.

SHYLOCK:
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.

TUBAL:
But Antonio is certainly undone.

SHYLOCK:
Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

PORTIA:
I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
There's something tells me, but it is not love,
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
To stay you from election.

BASSANIO:
Let me choose
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

PORTIA:
Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.

BASSANIO:
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

PORTIA:
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Where men enforced do speak anything.

BASSANIO:
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

PORTIA:
Well then, confess and live.

BASSANIO:
'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

PORTIA:
Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
And what is music then? Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished?
Reply, reply.
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.

ALL:
Ding, dong, bell.

BASSANIO:
So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valour's excrement
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

PORTIA:

BASSANIO:
What find I here?
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

PORTIA:
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
That only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

BASSANIO:
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

NERISSA:
My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

GRATIANO:
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Even at that time I may be married too.

BASSANIO:
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

GRATIANO:
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
You loved, I loved for intermission.
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
For wooing here until I sweat again,
And sweating until my very roof was dry
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love, provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress.

PORTIA:
Is this true, Nerissa?

NERISSA:
Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

BASSANIO:
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

GRATIANO:
Yes, faith, my lord.

BASSANIO:
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

GRATIANO:
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

NERISSA:
What, and stake down?

GRATIANO:
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?

BASSANIO:
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.

PORTIA:
So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.

LORENZO:
I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.

SALERIO:
I did, my lord;
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.

BASSANIO:
Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

SALERIO:
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
Will show you his estate.

GRATIANO:
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

SALERIO:
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

PORTIA:
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.

BASSANIO:
O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?

SALERIO:
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew,
He would not take it. Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

JESSICA:
When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
If law, authority and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

PORTIA:
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

BASSANIO:
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

PORTIA:
What sum owes he the Jew?

BASSANIO:
For me three thousand ducats.

PORTIA:
What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

BASSANIO:

PORTIA:
O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

BASSANIO:
Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste: but, till I come again,
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

SHYLOCK:
Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
Gaoler, look to him.

ANTONIO:
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

SHYLOCK:
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request.

ANTONIO:
I pray thee, hear me speak.

SHYLOCK:
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.

SALARINO:
It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.

ANTONIO:
Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.

SALARINO:
I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

ANTONIO:
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

LORENZO:
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

PORTIA:
I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together,
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here,
Until her husband and my lord's return:
There is a monastery two miles off;
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.

LORENZO:
Madam, with all my heart;
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

PORTIA:
My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.

LORENZO:
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

JESSICA:
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

PORTIA:
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
Now, Balthasar,
As I have ever found thee honest-true,
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.

BALTHASAR:
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

PORTIA:
Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
Before they think of us.

NERISSA:
Shall they see us?

PORTIA:
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
That they shall think we are accomplished
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutred like young men,
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
How honourable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
Which I will practise.

NERISSA:
Why, shall we turn to men?

PORTIA:
Fie, what a question's that,
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.

LAUNCELOT:
Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither.

JESSICA:
And what hope is that, I pray thee?

LAUNCELOT:
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.

JESSICA:
That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.

LAUNCELOT:
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
gone both ways.

JESSICA:
I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
Christian.

LAUNCELOT:
Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
another. This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.

JESSICA:
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.

LORENZO:
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
you thus get my wife into corners.

JESSICA:
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
price of pork.

LORENZO:
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.

LAUNCELOT:
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
indeed more than I took her for.

LORENZO:
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
and discourse grow commendable in none only but
parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.

LAUNCELOT:
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.

LORENZO:
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
them prepare dinner.

LAUNCELOT:
That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.

LORENZO:
Will you cover then, sir?

LAUNCELOT:
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.

LORENZO:
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.

LAUNCELOT:
For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
conceits shall govern.

LORENZO:
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words; and I do know
A many fools, that stand in better place,
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?

JESSICA:
Past all expressing. It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
In reason he should never come to heaven
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
And Portia one, there must be something else
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
Hath not her fellow.

LORENZO:
Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

JESSICA:
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

LORENZO:
I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.

JESSICA:
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

LORENZO:
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
I shall digest it.

JESSICA:
Well, I'll set you forth.

DUKE:
What, is Antonio here?

ANTONIO:
Ready, so please your grace.

DUKE:
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.

ANTONIO:
I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.

DUKE:
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

SALERIO:
He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

DUKE:
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

SHYLOCK:
I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

BASSANIO:
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

SHYLOCK:
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

BASSANIO:
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

SHYLOCK:
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

BASSANIO:
Every offence is not a hate at first.

SHYLOCK:
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

ANTONIO:
I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

BASSANIO:
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

SHYLOCK:
What judgment shall I dread, doing
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

DUKE:
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

SHYLOCK:
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?

DUKE:
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.

SALERIO:
My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.

DUKE:
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

BASSANIO:
Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

ANTONIO:
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

DUKE:
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

NERISSA:
From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.

BASSANIO:
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

SHYLOCK:
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

GRATIANO:
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?

SHYLOCK:
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

GRATIANO:
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

SHYLOCK:
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.

DUKE:
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?

NERISSA:
He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

DUKE:
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

Clerk:

DUKE:
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?

PORTIA:
I did, my lord.

DUKE:
You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

PORTIA:
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

DUKE:
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

PORTIA:
Is your name Shylock?

SHYLOCK:
Shylock is my name.

PORTIA:
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?

ANTONIO:
Ay, so he says.

PORTIA:
Do you confess the bond?

ANTONIO:
I do.

PORTIA:
Then must the Jew be merciful.

SHYLOCK:
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

PORTIA:
The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

SHYLOCK:
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

PORTIA:
Is he not able to discharge the money?

BASSANIO:
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

PORTIA:
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

SHYLOCK:
A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

PORTIA:
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

SHYLOCK:
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

PORTIA:
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

SHYLOCK:
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.

PORTIA:
Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

SHYLOCK:
When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

ANTONIO:
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.

PORTIA:
Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

SHYLOCK:
O noble judge! O excellent young man!

PORTIA:
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

SHYLOCK:
'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

PORTIA:
Therefore lay bare your bosom.

SHYLOCK:
Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

PORTIA:
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?

SHYLOCK:
I have them ready.

PORTIA:
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

SHYLOCK:
Is it so nominated in the bond?

PORTIA:
It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

SHYLOCK:
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

PORTIA:
You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

ANTONIO:
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

BASSANIO:
Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.

PORTIA:
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

GRATIANO:
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

NERISSA:
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

SHYLOCK:
These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

PORTIA:
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

SHYLOCK:
Most rightful judge!

PORTIA:
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

SHYLOCK:
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!

PORTIA:
Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the state of Venice.

GRATIANO:
O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

SHYLOCK:
Is that the law?

PORTIA:
Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

GRATIANO:
O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!

SHYLOCK:
I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.

BASSANIO:
Here is the money.

PORTIA:
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

GRATIANO:
O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!

PORTIA:
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

GRATIANO:
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

PORTIA:
Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

SHYLOCK:
Give me my principal, and let me go.

BASSANIO:
I have it ready for thee; here it is.

PORTIA:
He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.

GRATIANO:
A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

SHYLOCK:
Shall I not have barely my principal?

PORTIA:
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

SHYLOCK:
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.

PORTIA:
Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

GRATIANO:
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.

DUKE:
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

PORTIA:
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

SHYLOCK:
Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.

PORTIA:
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

GRATIANO:
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.

ANTONIO:
So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

DUKE:
He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.

PORTIA:
Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

SHYLOCK:
I am content.

PORTIA:
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

SHYLOCK:
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.

DUKE:
Get thee gone, but do it.

GRATIANO:
In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

DUKE:
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

PORTIA:
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.

DUKE:
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

BASSANIO:
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

ANTONIO:
And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.

PORTIA:
He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

BASSANIO:
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

PORTIA:
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.

BASSANIO:
This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
I will not shame myself to give you this.

PORTIA:
I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

BASSANIO:
There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

PORTIA:
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

BASSANIO:
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.

PORTIA:
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

ANTONIO:
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued against your wife's commandment.

BASSANIO:
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
Come, you and I will thither presently;
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.

PORTIA:
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

GRATIANO:
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.

PORTIA:
That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

GRATIANO:
That will I do.

NERISSA:
Sir, I would speak with you.
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

PORTIA:

NERISSA:
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

LORENZO:
The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.

JESSICA:
In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
And ran dismay'd away.

LORENZO:
In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.

JESSICA:
In such a night
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson.

LORENZO:
In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.

JESSICA:
In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
And ne'er a true one.

LORENZO:
In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

JESSICA:
I would out-night you, did no body come;
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.

LORENZO:
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

STEPHANO:
A friend.

LORENZO:
A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?

STEPHANO:
Stephano is my name; and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.

LORENZO:
Who comes with her?

STEPHANO:
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?

LORENZO:
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

LAUNCELOT:
Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!

LORENZO:
Who calls?

LAUNCELOT:
Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!

LORENZO:
Leave hollaing, man: here.

LAUNCELOT:
Sola! where? where?

LORENZO:
Here.

LAUNCELOT:
Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
ere morning.

LORENZO:
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
And bring your music forth into the air.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
And draw her home with music.

JESSICA:
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

LORENZO:
The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

PORTIA:
That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

NERISSA:
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

PORTIA:
So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Unto the king be by, and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!

NERISSA:
It is your music, madam, of the house.

PORTIA:
Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

NERISSA:
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

PORTIA:
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
When neither is attended, and I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked.

LORENZO:
That is the voice,
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

PORTIA:
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.

LORENZO:
Dear lady, welcome home.

PORTIA:
We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?

LORENZO:
Madam, they are not yet;
But there is come a messenger before,
To signify their coming.

PORTIA:
Go in, Nerissa;
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.

LORENZO:
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

PORTIA:
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

BASSANIO:
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

PORTIA:
Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.

BASSANIO:
I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

PORTIA:
You should in all sense be much bound to him.
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

ANTONIO:
No more than I am well acquitted of.

PORTIA:
Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

GRATIANO:

PORTIA:
A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?

GRATIANO:
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

NERISSA:
What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.

GRATIANO:
He will, an if he live to be a man.

NERISSA:
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

GRATIANO:
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
I could not for my heart deny it him.

PORTIA:
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

BASSANIO:

GRATIANO:
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.

PORTIA:
What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

BASSANIO:
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

PORTIA:
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.

NERISSA:
Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.

BASSANIO:
Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

PORTIA:
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honour to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

BASSANIO:
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

PORTIA:
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

NERISSA:
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

GRATIANO:
Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

ANTONIO:
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

PORTIA:
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

BASSANIO:
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--

PORTIA:
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.

BASSANIO:
Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.

ANTONIO:
I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

PORTIA:
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.

ANTONIO:
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

BASSANIO:
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

PORTIA:
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

NERISSA:
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

GRATIANO:
Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

PORTIA:
Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.

ANTONIO:
I am dumb.

BASSANIO:
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

GRATIANO:
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

NERISSA:
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

BASSANIO:
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

ANTONIO:
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.

PORTIA:
How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

NERISSA:
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.

LORENZO:
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

PORTIA:
It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.

GRATIANO:
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

First Witch:
When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch:
When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch:
That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch:
Where the place?

Second Witch:
Upon the heath.

Third Witch:
There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch:
I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch:
Paddock calls.

Third Witch:
Anon.

ALL:
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

DUNCAN:
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

MALCOLM:
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

Sergeant:
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN:
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

Sergeant:
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN:
Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant:
Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorise another Golgotha,
I cannot tell.
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN:
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
Who comes here?

MALCOLM:
The worthy thane of Ross.

LENNOX:
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS:
God save the king!

DUNCAN:
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

ROSS:
From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN:
Great happiness!

ROSS:
That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN:
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS:
I'll see it done.

DUNCAN:
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

First Witch:
Where hast thou been, sister?

Second Witch:
Killing swine.

Third Witch:
Sister, where thou?

First Witch:
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

Second Witch:
I'll give thee a wind.

First Witch:
Thou'rt kind.

Third Witch:
And I another.

First Witch:
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.

Second Witch:
Show me, show me.

First Witch:
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

Third Witch:
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.

ALL:
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! the charm's wound up.

MACBETH:
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO:
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

MACBETH:
Speak, if you can: what are you?

First Witch:
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

Second Witch:
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!

Third Witch:
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!

BANQUO:
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.

First Witch:
Hail!

Second Witch:
Hail!

Third Witch:
Hail!

First Witch:
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

Second Witch:
Not so happy, yet much happier.

Third Witch:
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

First Witch:
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH:
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

BANQUO:
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

MACBETH:
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

BANQUO:
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH:
Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO:
You shall be king.

MACBETH:
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

BANQUO:
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

ROSS:
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.

ANGUS:
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.

ROSS:
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.

BANQUO:
What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH:
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?

ANGUS:
Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.

MACBETH:

BANQUO:
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH:

BANQUO:
Look, how our partner's rapt.

MACBETH:

BANQUO:
New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.

MACBETH:

BANQUO:
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH:
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO:
Very gladly.

MACBETH:
Till then, enough. Come, friends.

DUNCAN:
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?

MALCOLM:
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die: who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
As 'twere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN:
There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH:
The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
Safe toward your love and honour.

DUNCAN:
Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO:
There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN:
My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.

MACBETH:
The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN:
My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH:

DUNCAN:
True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.

LADY MACBETH:
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.'
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
What is your tidings?

Messenger:
The king comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH:
Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.

Messenger:
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.

LADY MACBETH:
Give him tending;
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.

MACBETH:
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH:
And when goes hence?

MACBETH:
To-morrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH:
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH:
We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH:
Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.

DUNCAN:
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO:
This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.

DUNCAN:
See, see, our honour'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.

LADY MACBETH:
All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.

DUNCAN:
Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.

LADY MACBETH:
Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.

DUNCAN:
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.

MACBETH:
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on the other.
How now! what news?

LADY MACBETH:
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH:
Hath he ask'd for me?

LADY MACBETH:
Know you not he has?

MACBETH:
We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH:
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?

MACBETH:
Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH:
What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.

MACBETH:
If we should fail?

LADY MACBETH:
We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?

MACBETH:
Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done't?

LADY MACBETH:
Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?

MACBETH:
I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

BANQUO:
How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE:
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO:
And she goes down at twelve.

FLEANCE:
I take't, 'tis later, sir.

BANQUO:
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Give me my sword.
Who's there?

MACBETH:
A friend.

BANQUO:
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.

MACBETH:
Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect;
Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO:
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.

MACBETH:
I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.

BANQUO:
At your kind'st leisure.

MACBETH:
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honour for you.

BANQUO:
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd.

MACBETH:
Good repose the while!

BANQUO:
Thanks, sir: the like to you!

MACBETH:
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

LADY MACBETH:
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

MACBETH:

LADY MACBETH:
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
My husband!

MACBETH:
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH:
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?

MACBETH:
When?

LADY MACBETH:
Now.

MACBETH:
As I descended?

LADY MACBETH:
Ay.

MACBETH:
Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?

LADY MACBETH:
Donalbain.

MACBETH:
This is a sorry sight.

LADY MACBETH:
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH:
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
Again to sleep.

LADY MACBETH:
There are two lodged together.

MACBETH:
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'

LADY MACBETH:
Consider it not so deeply.

MACBETH:
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
Stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH:
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

MACBETH:
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--

LADY MACBETH:
What do you mean?

MACBETH:
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

LADY MACBETH:
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.

MACBETH:
I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.

LADY MACBETH:
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.

MACBETH:
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
Making the green one red.

LADY MACBETH:
My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white.
I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then! Your constancy
Hath left you unattended.
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH:
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

Porter:
Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
old turning the key.
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
time; have napkins enow about you; here
you'll sweat for't.
Knock,
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
in, equivocator.
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
roast your goose.
Knock,
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in
some of all professions that go the primrose
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

MACDUFF:
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?

Porter:
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.

MACDUFF:
What three things does drink especially provoke?

Porter:
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
it provokes the desire, but it takes
away the performance: therefore, much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF:
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

Porter:
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
think, being too strong for him, though he took
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
him.

MACDUFF:
Is thy master stirring?
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

LENNOX:
Good morrow, noble sir.

MACBETH:
Good morrow, both.

MACDUFF:
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

MACBETH:
Not yet.

MACDUFF:
He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.

MACBETH:
I'll bring you to him.

MACDUFF:
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.

MACBETH:
The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.

MACDUFF:
I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.

LENNOX:
Goes the king hence to-day?

MACBETH:
He does: he did appoint so.

LENNOX:
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
Was feverous and did shake.

MACBETH:
'Twas a rough night.

LENNOX:
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.

MACDUFF:
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!

MACBETH:
What's the matter.

MACDUFF:
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
The life o' the building!

MACBETH:
What is 't you say? the life?

LENNOX:
Mean you his majesty?

MACDUFF:
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See, and then speak yourselves.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.

LADY MACBETH:
What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

MACDUFF:
O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master 's murder'd!

LADY MACBETH:
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?

BANQUO:
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.

MACBETH:
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There 's nothing serious in mortality:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.

DONALBAIN:
What is amiss?

MACBETH:
You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

MACDUFF:
Your royal father 's murder'd.

MALCOLM:
O, by whom?

LENNOX:
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows:
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
Was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH:
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.

MACDUFF:
Wherefore did you so?

MACBETH:
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love known?

LADY MACBETH:
Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF:
Look to the lady.

MALCOLM:

DONALBAIN:

MALCOLM:

BANQUO:
Look to the lady:
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF:
And so do I.

ALL:
So all.

MACBETH:
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.

ALL:
Well contented.

MALCOLM:
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

DONALBAIN:
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM:
This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

Old Man:
Threescore and ten I can remember well:
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.

ROSS:
Ah, good father,
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?

Old Man:
'Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

ROSS:
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.

Old Man:
'Tis said they eat each other.

ROSS:
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF:
Why, see you not?

ROSS:
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF:
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS:
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF:
They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS:
'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF:
He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.

ROSS:
Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF:
Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.

ROSS:
Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF:
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

ROSS:
Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF:
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ROSS:
Farewell, father.

Old Man:
God's benison go with you; and with those
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

BANQUO:
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.

MACBETH:
Here's our chief guest.

LADY MACBETH:
If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.

MACBETH:
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
And I'll request your presence.

BANQUO:
Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.

MACBETH:
Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH:
We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
Is't far you ride?

BANQUO:
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH:
Fail not our feast.

BANQUO:
My lord, I will not.

MACBETH:
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

MACBETH:
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night: to make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
Our pleasure?

ATTENDANT:
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH:
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing;
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

First Murderer:
It was, so please your highness.

MACBETH:
Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

First Murderer:
You made it known to us.

MACBETH:
I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?

First Murderer:
We are men, my liege.

MACBETH:
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.

Second Murderer:
I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.

First Murderer:
And I another
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
That I would set my lie on any chance,
To mend it, or be rid on't.

MACBETH:
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.

Both Murderers:
True, my lord.

MACBETH:
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.

Second Murderer:
We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.

First Murderer:
Though our lives--

MACBETH:
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him--
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.

Both Murderers:
We are resolved, my lord.

MACBETH:
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

LADY MACBETH:
Is Banquo gone from court?

Servant:
Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.

LADY MACBETH:
Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.

Servant:
Madam, I will.

LADY MACBETH:
Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.

MACBETH:
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH:
Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

MACBETH:
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH:
You must leave this.

MACBETH:
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

LADY MACBETH:
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

MACBETH:
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH:
What's to be done?

MACBETH:
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.

First Murderer:
But who did bid thee join with us?

Third Murderer:
Macbeth.

Second Murderer:
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.

First Murderer:
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.

Third Murderer:
Hark! I hear horses.

BANQUO:

Second Murderer:
Then 'tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.

First Murderer:
His horses go about.

Third Murderer:
Almost a mile: but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.

Second Murderer:
A light, a light!

Third Murderer:
'Tis he.

First Murderer:
Stand to't.

BANQUO:
It will be rain to-night.

First Murderer:
Let it come down.

BANQUO:
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

Third Murderer:
Who did strike out the light?

First Murderer:
Wast not the way?

Third Murderer:
There's but one down; the son is fled.

Second Murderer:
We have lost
Best half of our affair.

First Murderer:
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

MACBETH:
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.

Lords:
Thanks to your majesty.

MACBETH:
Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.

LADY MACBETH:
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.

MACBETH:
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
The table round.
There's blood on thy face.

First Murderer:
'Tis Banquo's then.

MACBETH:
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?

First Murderer:
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

MACBETH:
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
Thou art the nonpareil.

First Murderer:
Most royal sir,
Fleance is 'scaped.

MACBETH:
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?

First Murderer:
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
The least a death to nature.

MACBETH:
Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
We'll hear, ourselves, again.

LADY MACBETH:
My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

MACBETH:
Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!

LENNOX:
May't please your highness sit.

MACBETH:
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!

ROSS:
His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
To grace us with your royal company.

MACBETH:
The table's full.

LENNOX:
Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH:
Where?

LENNOX:
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?

MACBETH:
Which of you have done this?

Lords:
What, my good lord?

MACBETH:
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS:
Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.

LADY MACBETH:
Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him,
You shall offend him and extend his passion:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

MACBETH:
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.

LADY MACBETH:
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
You look but on a stool.

MACBETH:
Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.

LADY MACBETH:
What, quite unmann'd in folly?

MACBETH:
If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH:
Fie, for shame!

MACBETH:
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools: this is more strange
Than such a murder is.

LADY MACBETH:
My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH:
I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.

Lords:
Our duties, and the pledge.

MACBETH:
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!

LADY MACBETH:
Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH:
What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
Why, so: being gone,
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

LADY MACBETH:
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.

MACBETH:
Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
When mine is blanched with fear.

ROSS:
What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH:
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

LENNOX:
Good night; and better health
Attend his majesty!

LADY MACBETH:
A kind good night to all!

MACBETH:
It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

LADY MACBETH:
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH:
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?

LADY MACBETH:
Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH:
I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

LADY MACBETH:
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH:
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.

First Witch:
Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.

HECATE:
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call'd to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now: get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' the morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny:
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and every thing beside.
I am for the air; this night I'll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
Great business must be wrought ere noon:
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that distill'd by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion:
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
And you all know, security
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

First Witch:
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.

LENNOX:
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
Things have been strangely borne. The
gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
should find
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?

Lord:
The son of Duncan,
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court, and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
That, by the help of these--with Him above
To ratify the work--we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
All which we pine for now: and this report
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX:
Sent he to Macduff?

Lord:
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer.'

LENNOX:
And that well might
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed!

Lord:
I'll send my prayers with him.

First Witch:
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

Second Witch:
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

Third Witch:
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.

First Witch:
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch:
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Third Witch:
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
For the ingredients of our cauldron.

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch:
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.

HECATE:
O well done! I commend your pains;
And every one shall share i' the gains;
And now about the cauldron sing,
Live elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.

Second Witch:
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!

MACBETH:
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?

ALL:
A deed without a name.

MACBETH:
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.

First Witch:
Speak.

Second Witch:
Demand.

Third Witch:
We'll answer.

First Witch:
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?

MACBETH:
Call 'em; let me see 'em.

First Witch:
Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw
Into the flame.

ALL:
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!

MACBETH:
Tell me, thou unknown power,--

First Witch:
He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

First Apparition:
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

MACBETH:
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
word more,--

First Witch:
He will not be commanded: here's another,
More potent than the first.

Second Apparition:
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

MACBETH:
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

Second Apparition:
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.

MACBETH:
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

ALL:
Listen, but speak not to't.

Third Apparition:
Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.

MACBETH:
That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

ALL:
Seek to know no more.

MACBETH:
I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

First Witch:
Show!

Second Witch:
Show!

Third Witch:
Show!

ALL:
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!

MACBETH:
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
What, is this so?

First Witch:
Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights:
I'll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round:
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay.

MACBETH:
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!

LENNOX:
What's your grace's will?

MACBETH:
Saw you the weird sisters?

LENNOX:
No, my lord.

MACBETH:
Came they not by you?

LENNOX:
No, indeed, my lord.

MACBETH:
Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

LENNOX:
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH:
Fled to England!

LENNOX:
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH:
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.

LADY MACDUFF:
What had he done, to make him fly the land?

ROSS:
You must have patience, madam.

LADY MACDUFF:
He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS:
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY MACDUFF:
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.

ROSS:
My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

LADY MACDUFF:
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

ROSS:
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.

LADY MACDUFF:
Sirrah, your father's dead;
And what will you do now? How will you live?

Son:
As birds do, mother.

LADY MACDUFF:
What, with worms and flies?

Son:
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY MACDUFF:
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.

Son:
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY MACDUFF:
Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?

Son:
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY MACDUFF:
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

Son:
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

LADY MACDUFF:
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
With wit enough for thee.

Son:
Was my father a traitor, mother?

LADY MACDUFF:
Ay, that he was.

Son:
What is a traitor?

LADY MACDUFF:
Why, one that swears and lies.

Son:
And be all traitors that do so?

LADY MACDUFF:
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

Son:
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY MACDUFF:
Every one.

Son:
Who must hang them?

LADY MACDUFF:
Why, the honest men.

Son:
Then the liars and swearers are fools,
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them.

LADY MACDUFF:
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt thou do for a father?

Son:
If he were dead, you'ld weep for
him: if you would not, it were a good sign
that I should quickly have a new father.

LADY MACDUFF:
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

Messenger:
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.

LADY MACDUFF:
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm?
What are these faces?

First Murderer:
Where is your husband?

LADY MACDUFF:
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.

First Murderer:
He's a traitor.

Son:
Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!

First Murderer:
What, you egg!
Young fry of treachery!

Son:
He has kill'd me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!

MALCOLM:
Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF:
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
Like syllable of dolour.

MALCOLM:
What I believe I'll wail,
What know believe, and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
but something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.

MACDUFF:
I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM:
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
your pardon;
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF:
I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM:
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF:
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
thy wrongs;
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM:
Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF:
What should he be?

MALCOLM:
It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF:
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM:
I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF:
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.

MALCOLM:
With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels and this other's house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF:
This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
With other graces weigh'd.

MALCOLM:
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them, but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.

MACDUFF:
O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM:
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF:
Fit to govern!
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM:
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country's to command:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

MACDUFF:
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.

MALCOLM:
Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

Doctor:
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The great assay of art; but at his touch--
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
They presently amend.

MALCOLM:
I thank you, doctor.

MACDUFF:
What's the disease he means?

MALCOLM:
'Tis call'd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
That speak him full of grace.

MACDUFF:
See, who comes here?

MALCOLM:
My countryman; but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF:
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM:
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS:
Sir, amen.

MACDUFF:
Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS:
Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF:
O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!

MALCOLM:
What's the newest grief?

ROSS:
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF:
How does my wife?

ROSS:
Why, well.

MACDUFF:
And all my children?

ROSS:
Well too.

MACDUFF:
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

ROSS:
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

MACDUFF:
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

ROSS:
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM:
Be't their comfort
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.

ROSS:
Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF:
What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

ROSS:
No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF:
If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

ROSS:
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF:
Hum! I guess at it.

ROSS:
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
To add the death of you.

MALCOLM:
Merciful heaven!
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

MACDUFF:
My children too?

ROSS:
Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.

MACDUFF:
And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?

ROSS:
I have said.

MALCOLM:
Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF:
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM:
Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF:
I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

MALCOLM:
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

MACDUFF:
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too!

MALCOLM:
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.

Doctor:
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

Gentlewoman:
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

Doctor:
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
time, have you heard her say?

Gentlewoman:
That, sir, which I will not report after her.

Doctor:
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

Gentlewoman:
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
confirm my speech.
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

Doctor:
How came she by that light?

Gentlewoman:
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
continually; 'tis her command.

Doctor:
You see, her eyes are open.

Gentlewoman:
Ay, but their sense is shut.

Doctor:
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

Gentlewoman:
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH:
Yet here's a spot.

Doctor:
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH:
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him.

Doctor:
Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH:
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
this starting.

Doctor:
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

Gentlewoman:
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
that: heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH:
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh, oh, oh!

Doctor:
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

Gentlewoman:
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body.

Doctor:
Well, well, well,--

Gentlewoman:
Pray God it be, sir.

Doctor:
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH:
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
cannot come out on's grave.

Doctor:
Even so?

LADY MACBETH:
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

Doctor:
Will she go now to bed?

Gentlewoman:
Directly.

Doctor:
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.

Gentlewoman:
Good night, good doctor.

MENTEITH:
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS:
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS:
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX:
For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH:
What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS:
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS:
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH:
Who then shall blame
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS:
Well, march we on,
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.

LENNOX:
Or so much as it needs,
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.

MACBETH:
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?

Servant:
There is ten thousand--

MACBETH:
Geese, villain!

Servant:
Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH:
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

Servant:
The English force, so please you.

MACBETH:
Take thy face hence.
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough: my way of life
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!

SEYTON:
What is your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH:
What news more?

SEYTON:
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH:
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.

SEYTON:
'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH:
I'll put it on.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient, doctor?

Doctor:
Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH:
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

Doctor:
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

MACBETH:
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

Doctor:
Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

MACBETH:
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

Doctor:

MALCOLM:
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH:
We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD:
What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH:
The wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM:
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.

Soldiers:
It shall be done.

SIWARD:
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down before 't.

MALCOLM:
'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF:
Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD:
The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
Towards which advance the war.

MACBETH:
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
What is that noise?

SEYTON:
It is the cry of women, my good lord.

MACBETH:
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me.
Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON:
The queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH:
She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

Messenger:
Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do it.

MACBETH:
Well, say, sir.

Messenger:
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The wood began to move.

MACBETH:
Liar and slave!

Messenger:
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH:
If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution, and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I gin to be aweary of the sun,
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.

MALCOLM:
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.

SIWARD:
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF:
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

MACBETH:
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

YOUNG SIWARD:
What is thy name?

MACBETH:
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD:
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.

MACBETH:
My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD:
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH:
No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG SIWARD:
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

MACBETH:
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

MACDUFF:
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.

SIWARD:
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.

MALCOLM:
We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

SIWARD:
Enter, sir, the castle.

MACBETH:
Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.

MACDUFF:
Turn, hell-hound, turn!

MACBETH:
Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF:
I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!

MACBETH:
Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
To one of woman born.

MACDUFF:
Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH:
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
That palter with us in a double sense;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF:
Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
'Here may you see the tyrant.'

MACBETH:
I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

MALCOLM:
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD:
Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM:
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS:
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
He only lived but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

SIWARD:
Then he is dead?

ROSS:
Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

SIWARD:
Had he his hurts before?

ROSS:
Ay, on the front.

SIWARD:
Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death:
And so, his knell is knoll'd.

MALCOLM:
He's worth more sorrow,
And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD:
He's worth no more
They say he parted well, and paid his score:
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

MACDUFF:
Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL:
Hail, King of Scotland!

MALCOLM:
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named. What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

THESEUS:
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man revenue.

HIPPOLYTA:
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

THESEUS:
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.

EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

THESEUS:
Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

EGEUS:
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

THESEUS:
What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

HERMIA:
So is Lysander.

THESEUS:
In himself he is;
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.

HERMIA:
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

THESEUS:
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

HERMIA:
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

THESEUS:
Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

HERMIA:
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

THESEUS:
Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.

DEMETRIUS:
Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

LYSANDER:
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.

EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.

LYSANDER:
I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

THESEUS:
I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

EGEUS:
With duty and desire we follow you.

LYSANDER:
How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

HERMIA:
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

LYSANDER:
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But, either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA:
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

LYSANDER:
Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--

HERMIA:
O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

LYSANDER:
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--

HERMIA:
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

LYSANDER:
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.

HERMIA:
If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

LYSANDER:
A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.

HERMIA:
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

LYSANDER:
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

HERMIA:
God speed fair Helena! whither away?

HELENA:
Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

HERMIA:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

HELENA:
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

HERMIA:
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

HELENA:
O that my prayers could such affection move!

HERMIA:
The more I hate, the more he follows me.

HELENA:
The more I love, the more he hateth me.

HERMIA:
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

HELENA:
None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

HERMIA:
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

LYSANDER:
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.

HERMIA:
And in the wood, where often you and I
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

LYSANDER:
I will, my Hermia.
Helena, adieu:
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

HELENA:
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.

QUINCE:
Is all our company here?

BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by man,
according to the scrip.

QUINCE:
Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
wedding-day at night.

BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.

QUINCE:
Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.

BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

QUINCE:
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.

BOTTOM:
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

QUINCE:
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?

QUINCE:
A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
more condoling.

QUINCE:
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.

FLUTE:
Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE:
Flute, you must take Thisby on you.

FLUTE:
What is Thisby? a wandering knight?

QUINCE:
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

FLUTE:
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.

QUINCE:
That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.

BOTTOM:
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!'

QUINCE:
No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.

BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.

QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, the tailor.

STARVELING:
Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.

SNOUT:
Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE:
You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.

SNUG:
Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

QUINCE:
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

BOTTOM:
Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
let him roar again.'

QUINCE:
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
and that were enough to hang us all.

ALL:
That would hang us, every mother's son.

BOTTOM:
I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
nightingale.

QUINCE:
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
to play it in?

QUINCE:
Why, what you will.

BOTTOM:
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.

QUINCE:
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
wants. I pray you, fail me not.

BOTTOM:
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

QUINCE:
At the duke's oak we meet.

BOTTOM:
Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

PUCK:
How now, spirit! whither wander you?

Fairy:
Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours,
In those freckles live their savours:
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

PUCK:
The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

Fairy:
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery;
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
Are not you he?

PUCK:
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

Fairy:
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

OBERON:
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

TITANIA:
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn his bed and company.

OBERON:
Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?

TITANIA:
Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.

OBERON:
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?

TITANIA:
These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.

OBERON:
Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy,
To be my henchman.

TITANIA:
Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

OBERON:
How long within this wood intend you stay?

TITANIA:
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

OBERON:
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

TITANIA:
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

OBERON:
Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
To hear the sea-maid's music.

PUCK:
I remember.

OBERON:
That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

PUCK:
I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.

OBERON:
Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.

DEMETRIUS:
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

HELENA:
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.

DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?

HELENA:
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?

DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.

HELENA:
And I am sick when I look not on you.

DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.

HELENA:
Your virtue is my privilege: for that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?

DEMETRIUS:
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

HELENA:
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.

DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

HELENA:
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be wood and were not made to woo.
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.

OBERON:
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.

PUCK:
Ay, there it is.

OBERON:
I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

PUCK:
Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

TITANIA:
Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
Never harm,
Nor spell nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.
Weaving spiders, come not here;
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
Worm nor snail, do no offence.
Philomel, with melody, &c.

Fairy:
Hence, away! now all is well:
One aloof stand sentinel.

OBERON:
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Do it for thy true-love take,
Love and languish for his sake:
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
Wake when some vile thing is near.

LYSANDER:
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.

HERMIA:
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head.

LYSANDER:
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.

HERMIA:
Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

LYSANDER:
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

HERMIA:
Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

LYSANDER:
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!

HERMIA:
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!

PUCK:
Through the forest have I gone.
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.

HELENA:
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

HELENA:
O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

DEMETRIUS:
Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.

HELENA:
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.

LYSANDER:

HELENA:
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.

LYSANDER:
Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories written in love's richest book.

HELENA:
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady, of one man refused.
Should of another therefore be abused!

LYSANDER:
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
Or as tie heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen and to be her knight!

HERMIA:

BOTTOM:
Are we all met?

QUINCE:
Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.

BOTTOM:
Peter Quince,--

QUINCE:
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

BOTTOM:
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?

SNOUT:
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.

STARVELING:
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

BOTTOM:
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
out of fear.

QUINCE:
Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
written in eight and six.

BOTTOM:
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

SNOUT:
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?

STARVELING:
I fear it, I promise you.

BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to 't.

SNOUT:
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

QUINCE:
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.

SNOUT:
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

BOTTOM:
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.

QUINCE:
Yes, it doth shine that night.

BOTTOM:
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.

QUINCE:
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.

SNOUT:
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?

BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.

QUINCE:
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
according to his cue.

PUCK:
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.

QUINCE:
Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.

BOTTOM:
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--

QUINCE:
Odours, odours.

BOTTOM:
--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.

PUCK:
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.

FLUTE:
Must I speak now?

QUINCE:
Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.

FLUTE:
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.

QUINCE:
'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
is past; it is, 'never tire.'

FLUTE:
O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
never tire.

BOTTOM:
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.

QUINCE:
O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
masters! fly, masters! Help!

PUCK:
I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

BOTTOM:
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
make me afeard.

SNOUT:
O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?

BOTTOM:
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
you?

QUINCE:
Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
translated.

BOTTOM:
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
I am not afraid.
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill,--

TITANIA:

BOTTOM:

TITANIA:
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

BOTTOM:
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

TITANIA:
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

BOTTOM:
Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.

TITANIA:
Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!

PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.

COBWEB:
And I.

MOTH:
And I.

MUSTARDSEED:
And I.

ALL:
Where shall we go?

TITANIA:
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

PEASEBLOSSOM:
Hail, mortal!

COBWEB:
Hail!

MOTH:
Hail!

MUSTARDSEED:
Hail!

BOTTOM:
I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
worship's name.

COBWEB:
Cobweb.

BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
you. Your name, honest gentleman?

PEASEBLOSSOM:
Peaseblossom.

BOTTOM:
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?

MUSTARDSEED:
Mustardseed.

BOTTOM:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
desire your more acquaintance, good Master
Mustardseed.

TITANIA:
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.

OBERON:
I wonder if Titania be awaked;
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
Here comes my messenger.
How now, mad spirit!
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?

PUCK:
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

OBERON:
This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?

PUCK:
I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.

OBERON:
Stand close: this is the same Athenian.

PUCK:
This is the woman, but not this the man.

DEMETRIUS:
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

HERMIA:
Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

DEMETRIUS:
So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

HERMIA:
What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

DEMETRIUS:
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

HERMIA:
Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

HERMIA:
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

DEMETRIUS:
An if I could, what should I get therefore?

HERMIA:
A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so:
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.

OBERON:
What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.

PUCK:
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

OBERON:
About the wood go swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
By some illusion see thou bring her here:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.

PUCK:
I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

OBERON:
Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid's archery,
Sink in apple of his eye.
When his love he doth espy,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wakest, if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy.

PUCK:
Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand;
And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover's fee.
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!

OBERON:
Stand aside: the noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake.

PUCK:
Then will two at once woo one;
That must needs be sport alone;
And those things do best please me
That befal preposterously.

LYSANDER:
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?

HELENA:
You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

LYSANDER:
I had no judgment when to her I swore.

HELENA:
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

LYSANDER:
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

DEMETRIUS:

HELENA:
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

LYSANDER:
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.

HELENA:
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.

LYSANDER:
Helen, it is not so.

DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

HERMIA:
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

LYSANDER:
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

HERMIA:
What love could press Lysander from my side?

LYSANDER:
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

HERMIA:
You speak not as you think: it cannot be.

HELENA:
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.

HERMIA:
I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.

HELENA:
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What thought I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.

HERNIA:
I understand not what you mean by this.

HELENA:
Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

LYSANDER:
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!

HELENA:
O excellent!

HERMIA:
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

LYSANDER:
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false that says I love thee not.

DEMETRIUS:
I say I love thee more than he can do.

LYSANDER:
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

DEMETRIUS:
Quick, come!

HERMIA:
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

LYSANDER:
Away, you Ethiope!

DEMETRIUS:
No, no; he'll
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!

LYSANDER:
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!

HERMIA:
Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--

LYSANDER:
Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!

HERMIA:
Do you not jest?

HELENA:
Yes, sooth; and so do you.

LYSANDER:
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.

LYSANDER:
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.

HERMIA:
What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
In earnest, shall I say?

LYSANDER:
Ay, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.

HERMIA:
O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?

HELENA:
Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

HERMIA:
Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

HELENA:
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.

HERMIA:
Lower! hark, again.

HELENA:
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.

HERMIA:
Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

HELENA:
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

HERMIA:
What, with Lysander?

HELENA:
With Demetrius.

LYSANDER:
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

DEMETRIUS:
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

HELENA:
O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.

HERMIA:
'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.

LYSANDER:
Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
You bead, you acorn.

DEMETRIUS:
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.

LYSANDER:
Now she holds me not;
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

DEMETRIUS:
Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.

HERMIA:
You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
Nay, go not back.

HELENA:
I will not trust you, I,
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though, to run away.

HERMIA:
I am amazed, and know not what to say.

OBERON:
This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.

PUCK:
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment be had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

OBERON:
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

PUCK:
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
That in crossways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone;
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
They willfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.

OBERON:
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
We may effect this business yet ere day.

PUCK:
Up and down, up and down,
I will lead them up and down:
I am fear'd in field and town:
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.

LYSANDER:
Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.

PUCK:
Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?

LYSANDER:
I will be with thee straight.

PUCK:
Follow me, then,
To plainer ground.

DEMETRIUS:
Lysander! speak again:
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?

PUCK:
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

DEMETRIUS:
Yea, art thou there?

PUCK:
Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.

LYSANDER:
He goes before me and still dares me on:
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me.
Come, thou gentle day!
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.

PUCK:
Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?

DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?

PUCK:
Come hither: I am here.

DEMETRIUS:
Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.

HELENA:
O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
From these that my poor company detest:
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.

PUCK:
Yet but three? Come one more;
Two of both kinds make up four.
Here she comes, curst and sad:
Cupid is a knavish lad,
Thus to make poor females mad.

HERMIA:
Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

PUCK:
On the ground
Sleep sound:
I'll apply
To your eye,
Gentle lover, remedy.
When thou wakest,
Thou takest
True delight
In the sight
Of thy former lady's eye:
And the country proverb known,
That every man should take his own,
In your waking shall be shown:
Jack shall have Jill;
Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

TITANIA:
Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

BOTTOM:
Where's Peaseblossom?

PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.

BOTTOM:
Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

COBWEB:
Ready.

BOTTOM:
Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
I would be loath to have you overflown with a
honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?

MUSTARDSEED:
Ready.

BOTTOM:
Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.

MUSTARDSEED:
What's your Will?

BOTTOM:
Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
I must scratch.

TITANIA:
What, wilt thou hear some music,
my sweet love?

BOTTOM:
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
the tongs and the bones.

TITANIA:
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

BOTTOM:
Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.

TITANIA:
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.

BOTTOM:
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

TITANIA:
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gently entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!

OBERON:

TITANIA:
My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.

OBERON:
There lies your love.

TITANIA:
How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

OBERON:
Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.

TITANIA:
Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!

PUCK:
Now, when thou wakest, with thine
own fool's eyes peep.

OBERON:
Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

PUCK:
Fairy king, attend, and mark:
I do hear the morning lark.

OBERON:
Then, my queen, in silence sad,
Trip we after the night's shade:
We the globe can compass soon,
Swifter than the wandering moon.

TITANIA:
Come, my lord, and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With these mortals on the ground.

THESEUS:
Go, one of you, find out the forester;
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.

HIPPOLYTA:
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

THESEUS:
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?

EGEUS:
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
I wonder of their being here together.

THESEUS:
No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
Came here in grace our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

EGEUS:
It is, my lord.

THESEUS:
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?

LYSANDER:
Pardon, my lord.

THESEUS:
I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies:
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
That hatred is so far from jealousy,
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?

LYSANDER:
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here;
But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
I came with Hermia hither: our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
Without the peril of the Athenian law.

EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me,
You of your wife and me of my consent,
Of my consent that she should be your wife.

DEMETRIUS:
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
And I in fury hither follow'd them,
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.

THESEUS:
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will;
For in the temple by and by with us
These couples shall eternally be knit:
And, for the morning now is something worn,
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
Away with us to Athens; three and three,
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Come, Hippolyta.

DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small and undistinguishable,

HERMIA:
Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every thing seems double.

HELENA:
So methinks:
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.

DEMETRIUS:
Are you sure
That we are awake? It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?

HERMIA:
Yea; and my father.

HELENA:
And Hippolyta.

LYSANDER:
And he did bid us follow to the temple.

DEMETRIUS:
Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
And by the way let us recount our dreams.

BOTTOM:

QUINCE:
Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?

STARVELING:
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
transported.

FLUTE:
If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
not forward, doth it?

QUINCE:
It is not possible: you have not a man in all
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.

FLUTE:
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
man in Athens.

QUINCE:
Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
paramour for a sweet voice.

FLUTE:
You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
a thing of naught.

SNUG:
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
men.

FLUTE:
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
Pyramus, or nothing.

BOTTOM:
Where are these lads? where are these hearts?

QUINCE:
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!

BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.

QUINCE:
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

BOTTOM:
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

HIPPOLYTA:
'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
lovers speak of.

THESEUS:
More strange than true: I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

HIPPOLYTA:
But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images
And grows to something of great constancy;
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

THESEUS:
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts!

LYSANDER:
More than to us
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!

THESEUS:
Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
To wear away this long age of three hours
Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.

PHILOSTRATE:
Here, mighty Theseus.

THESEUS:
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time, if not with some delight?

PHILOSTRATE:
There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
Make choice of which your highness will see first.

THESEUS:

PHILOSTRATE:
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.

THESEUS:
What are they that do play it?

PHILOSTRATE:
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
With this same play, against your nuptial.

THESEUS:
And we will hear it.

PHILOSTRATE:
No, my noble lord;
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
To do you service.

THESEUS:
I will hear that play;
For never anything can be amiss,
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.

HIPPOLYTA:
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
And duty in his service perishing.

THESEUS:
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

HIPPOLYTA:
He says they can do nothing in this kind.

THESEUS:
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most, to my capacity.

PHILOSTRATE:
So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.

THESEUS:
Let him approach.

Prologue:
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.

THESEUS:
This fellow doth not stand upon points.

LYSANDER:
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
enough to speak, but to speak true.

HIPPOLYTA:
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.

THESEUS:
His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?

Prologue:
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain.

THESEUS:
I wonder if the lion be to speak.

DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.

Wall:
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
And such a wall, as I would have you think,
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

THESEUS:
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?

DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.

THESEUS:
Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!

Pyramus:
O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

THESEUS:
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

Pyramus:
No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

Thisbe:
O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

Pyramus:
I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!

Thisbe:
My love thou art, my love I think.

Pyramus:
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

Thisbe:
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

Pyramus:
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

Thisbe:
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

Pyramus:
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!

Thisbe:
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.

Pyramus:
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?

Thisbe:
'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.

Wall:
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.

THESEUS:
Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.

DEMETRIUS:
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning.

HIPPOLYTA:
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.

THESEUS:
The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
are no worse, if imagination amend them.

HIPPOLYTA:
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.

THESEUS:
If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.

Lion:
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
For, if I should as lion come in strife
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.

THESEUS:
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.

DEMETRIUS:
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.

LYSANDER:
This lion is a very fox for his valour.

THESEUS:
True; and a goose for his discretion.

DEMETRIUS:
Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.

THESEUS:
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.

Moonshine:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--

DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head.

THESEUS:
He is no crescent, and his horns are
invisible within the circumference.

Moonshine:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.

THESEUS:
This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
man i' the moon?

DEMETRIUS:
He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
see, it is already in snuff.

HIPPOLYTA:
I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!

THESEUS:
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
reason, we must stay the time.

LYSANDER:
Proceed, Moon.

Moonshine:
All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.

DEMETRIUS:
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.

Thisbe:
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?

Lion:

DEMETRIUS:
Well roared, Lion.

THESEUS:
Well run, Thisbe.

HIPPOLYTA:
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
good grace.

THESEUS:
Well moused, Lion.

LYSANDER:
And so the lion vanished.

DEMETRIUS:
And then came Pyramus.

Pyramus:
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,
What, stain'd with blood!
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

THESEUS:
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
go near to make a man look sad.

HIPPOLYTA:
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

Pyramus:
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus;
Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:
Tongue, lose thy light;
Moon take thy flight:
Now die, die, die, die, die.

DEMETRIUS:
No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.

LYSANDER:
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.

THESEUS:
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
prove an ass.

HIPPOLYTA:
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?

THESEUS:
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
her passion ends the play.

HIPPOLYTA:
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.

DEMETRIUS:
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
she for a woman, God bless us.

LYSANDER:
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.

DEMETRIUS:
And thus she means, videlicet:--

Thisbe:
Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These My lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Are gone, are gone:
Lovers, make moan:
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters Three,
Come, come to me,
With hands as pale as milk;
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word:
Come, trusty sword;
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
And, farewell, friends;
Thus Thisby ends:
Adieu, adieu, adieu.

THESEUS:
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.

DEMETRIUS:
Ay, and Wall too.

BOTTOM:

THESEUS:
No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
epilogue alone.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
In nightly revels and new jollity.

PUCK:
Now the hungry lion roars,
And the wolf behowls the moon;
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow,
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide,
Every one lets forth his sprite,
In the church-way paths to glide:
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate's team,
From the presence of the sun,
Following darkness like a dream,
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.

OBERON:
Through the house give gathering light,
By the dead and drowsy fire:
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier;
And this ditty, after me,
Sing, and dance it trippingly.

TITANIA:
First, rehearse your song by rote
To each word a warbling note:
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
Will we sing, and bless this place.

OBERON:
Now, until the break of day,
Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessed be;
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be;
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity,
Shall upon their children be.
With this field-dew consecrate,
Every fairy take his gait;
And each several chamber bless,
Through this palace, with sweet peace;
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away; make no stay;
Meet me all by break of day.

PUCK:
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
if you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.

FERDINAND:
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE:
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN:
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.

BIRON:
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

FERDINAND:
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BIRON:
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE:
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.

BIRON:
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.

FERDINAND:
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

BIRON:
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

FERDINAND:
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.

BIRON:
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

FERDINAND:
These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.

BIRON:
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

FERDINAND:
How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN:
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE:
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.

BIRON:
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN:
How follows that?

BIRON:
Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN:
In reason nothing.

BIRON:
Something then in rhyme.

FERDINAND:
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BIRON:
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

FERDINAND:
Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.

BIRON:
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

FERDINAND:
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BIRON:

LONGAVILLE:
Four days ago.

BIRON:
Let's see the penalty.
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?

LONGAVILLE:
Marry, that did I.

BIRON:
Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE:
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BIRON:
A dangerous law against gentility!
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

FERDINAND:
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BIRON:
So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

FERDINAND:
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.

BIRON:
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might master'd but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

FERDINAND:
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BIRON:
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE:
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study, three years is but short.

DULL:
Which is the duke's own person?

BIRON:
This, fellow: what wouldst?

DULL:
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.

BIRON:
This is he.

DULL:
Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD:
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

FERDINAND:
A letter from the magnificent Armado.

BIRON:
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE:
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!

BIRON:
To hear? or forbear laughing?

LONGAVILLE:
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
forbear both.

BIRON:
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.

COSTARD:
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BIRON:
In what manner?

COSTARD:
In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.

BIRON:
For the following, sir?

COSTARD:
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!

FERDINAND:
Will you hear this letter with attention?

BIRON:
As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD:
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
Not a word of Costard yet.

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.

FERDINAND:
Peace!

COSTARD:
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!

FERDINAND:
No words!

COSTARD:
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
Me?

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
Me?

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
Still me?

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
O, me!

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
With a wench.

FERDINAND:

DULL:
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

FERDINAND:

BIRON:
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.

FERDINAND:
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
you to this?

COSTARD:
Sir, I confess the wench.

FERDINAND:
Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD:
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.

FERDINAND:
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
with a wench.

COSTARD:
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.

FERDINAND:
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'

COSTARD:
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.

FERDINAND:
It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'

COSTARD:
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.

FERDINAND:
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.

COSTARD:
This maid will serve my turn, sir.

FERDINAND:
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
a week with bran and water.

COSTARD:
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

FERDINAND:
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

BIRON:
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD:
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?

MOTH:
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH:
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?

MOTH:
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why tough senior? why tough senior?

MOTH:
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.

MOTH:
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Pretty and apt.

MOTH:
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH:
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH:
Speak you this in my praise, master?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
In thy condign praise.

MOTH:
I will praise an eel with the same praise.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What, that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH:
That an eel is quick.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

MOTH:
I am answered, sir.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love not to be crossed.

MOTH:

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I have promised to study three years with the duke.

MOTH:
You may do it in an hour, sir.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Impossible.

MOTH:
How many is one thrice told?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH:
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.

MOTH:
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH:
Which the base vulgar do call three.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
True.

MOTH:
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most fine figure!

MOTH:
To prove you a cipher.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?

MOTH:
Hercules, master.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.

MOTH:
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?

MOTH:
A woman, master.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Of what complexion?

MOTH:
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH:
Of the sea-water green, sir.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH:
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH:
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH:
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH:
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!

MOTH:
If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
By this you shall not know,
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
white and red.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH:
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

MOTH:

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH:
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say, sing.

MOTH:
Forbear till this company be past.

DULL:
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

JAQUENETTA:
Man?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will visit thee at the lodge.

JAQUENETTA:
That's hereby.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I know where it is situate.

JAQUENETTA:
Lord, how wise you are!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will tell thee wonders.

JAQUENETTA:
With that face?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love thee.

JAQUENETTA:
So I heard you say.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And so, farewell.

JAQUENETTA:
Fair weather after you!

DULL:
Come, Jaquenetta, away!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.

COSTARD:
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD:
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Take away this villain; shut him up.

MOTH:
Come, you transgressing slave; away!

COSTARD:
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

MOTH:
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.

COSTARD:
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.

MOTH:
What shall some see?

COSTARD:
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

BOYET:
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

PRINCESS:
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

BOYET:
Proud of employment, willingly I go.

PRINCESS:
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

First Lord:
Lord Longaville is one.

PRINCESS:
Know you the man?

MARIA:
I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.

PRINCESS:
Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

MARIA:
They say so most that most his humours know.

PRINCESS:
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?

KATHARINE:
The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.

ROSALINE:
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

PRINCESS:
God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

First Lord:
Here comes Boyet.

PRINCESS:
Now, what admittance, lord?

BOYET:
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.

FERDINAND:
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

PRINCESS:
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

FERDINAND:
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

PRINCESS:
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

FERDINAND:
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

PRINCESS:
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

FERDINAND:
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

PRINCESS:
Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

FERDINAND:
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

PRINCESS:
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

FERDINAND:
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

PRINCESS:
You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

BIRON:
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

ROSALINE:
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BIRON:
I know you did.

ROSALINE:
How needless was it then to ask the question!

BIRON:
You must not be so quick.

ROSALINE:
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

BIRON:
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

ROSALINE:
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

BIRON:
What time o' day?

ROSALINE:
The hour that fools should ask.

BIRON:
Now fair befall your mask!

ROSALINE:
Fair fall the face it covers!

BIRON:
And send you many lovers!

ROSALINE:
Amen, so you be none.

BIRON:
Nay, then will I be gone.

FERDINAND:
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.

PRINCESS:
You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

FERDINAND:
I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.

PRINCESS:
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.

FERDINAND:
Satisfy me so.

BOYET:
So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

FERDINAND:
It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.

PRINCESS:
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

FERDINAND:
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

BIRON:
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

ROSALINE:
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.

BIRON:
I would you heard it groan.

ROSALINE:
Is the fool sick?

BIRON:
Sick at the heart.

ROSALINE:
Alack, let it blood.

BIRON:
Would that do it good?

ROSALINE:
My physic says 'ay.'

BIRON:
Will you prick't with your eye?

ROSALINE:
No point, with my knife.

BIRON:
Now, God save thy life!

ROSALINE:
And yours from long living!

BIRON:
I cannot stay thanksgiving.

DUMAIN:
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET:
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN:
A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.

LONGAVILLE:
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

BOYET:
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

LONGAVILLE:
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

BOYET:
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

LONGAVILLE:
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

BOYET:
Her mother's, I have heard.

LONGAVILLE:
God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET:
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.

LONGAVILLE:
Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.

BOYET:
Not unlike, sir, that may be.

BIRON:
What's her name in the cap?

BOYET:
Rosaline, by good hap.

BIRON:
Is she wedded or no?

BOYET:
To her will, sir, or so.

BIRON:
You are welcome, sir: adieu.

BOYET:
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

MARIA:
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.

BOYET:
And every jest but a word.

PRINCESS:
It was well done of you to take him at his word.

BOYET:
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

MARIA:
Two hot sheeps, marry.

BOYET:
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

MARIA:
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

BOYET:
So you grant pasture for me.

MARIA:
Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.

BOYET:
Belonging to whom?

MARIA:
To my fortunes and me.

PRINCESS:
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

BOYET:
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

PRINCESS:
With what?

BOYET:
With that which we lovers entitle affected.

PRINCESS:
Your reason?

BOYET:
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

PRINCESS:
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.

BOYET:
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

ROSALINE:
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

MARIA:
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.

ROSALINE:
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

BOYET:
Do you hear, my mad wenches?

MARIA:
No.

BOYET:
What then, do you see?

ROSALINE:
Ay, our way to be gone.

BOYET:
You are too hard for me.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

MOTH:
Concolinel.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH:
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How meanest thou? brawling in French?

MOTH:
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note--do you note
me?--that most are affected to these.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH:
By my penny of observation.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But O,--but O,--

MOTH:
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH:
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Almost I had.

MOTH:
Negligent student! learn her by heart.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH:
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What wilt thou prove?

MOTH:
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am all these three.

MOTH:
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
all.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.

MOTH:
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

MOTH:
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The way is but short: away!

MOTH:
As swift as lead, sir.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH:
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say lead is slow.

MOTH:
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH:
Thump then and I flee.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.

MOTH:
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD:
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
the word l'envoy for a salve?

MOTH:
Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH:
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.

MOTH:
Until the goose came out of door,
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoy.
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.

MOTH:
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
desire more?

COSTARD:
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH:
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD:
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH:
I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD:
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD:
Till there be more matter in the shin.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD:
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.

COSTARD:
True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
bear this significant
to the country maid Jaquenetta:
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

MOTH:
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

COSTARD:
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
never buy and sell out of this word.

BIRON:
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.

COSTARD:
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
buy for a remuneration?

BIRON:
What is a remuneration?

COSTARD:
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BIRON:
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD:
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!

BIRON:
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD:
When would you have it done, sir?

BIRON:
This afternoon.

COSTARD:
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.

BIRON:
Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD:
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BIRON:
Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD:
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

BIRON:
It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

COSTARD:
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

BIRON:
And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.

PRINCESS:
Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill?

BOYET:
I know not; but I think it was not he.

PRINCESS:
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?

Forester:
Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.

PRINCESS:
I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

Forester:
Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.

PRINCESS:
What, what? first praise me and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!

Forester:
Yes, madam, fair.

PRINCESS:
Nay, never paint me now:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

Forester:
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.

PRINCESS:
See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And out of question so it is sometimes,
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.

BOYET:
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?

PRINCESS:
Only for praise: and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.

BOYET:
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.

COSTARD:
God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?

PRINCESS:
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.

COSTARD:
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?

PRINCESS:
The thickest and the tallest.

COSTARD:
The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.

PRINCESS:
What's your will, sir? what's your will?

COSTARD:
I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.

PRINCESS:
O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
Break up this capon.

BOYET:
I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

PRINCESS:
We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.

BOYET:
'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

PRINCESS:
What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?

BOYET:
I am much deceived but I remember the style.

PRINCESS:
Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

BOYET:
This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.

PRINCESS:
Thou fellow, a word:
Who gave thee this letter?

COSTARD:
I told you; my lord.

PRINCESS:
To whom shouldst thou give it?

COSTARD:
From my lord to my lady.

PRINCESS:
From which lord to which lady?

COSTARD:
From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.

PRINCESS:
Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.

BOYET:
Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

ROSALINE:
Shall I teach you to know?

BOYET:
Ay, my continent of beauty.

ROSALINE:
Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!

BOYET:
My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!

ROSALINE:
Well, then, I am the shooter.

BOYET:
And who is your deer?

ROSALINE:
If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
Finely put on, indeed!

MARIA:
You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
at the brow.

BOYET:
But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

ROSALINE:
Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
touching the hit it?

BOYET:
So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
wench, as touching the hit it.

ROSALINE:
Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

BOYET:
An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.

COSTARD:
By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!

MARIA:
A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.

BOYET:
A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

MARIA:
Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.

COSTARD:
Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.

BOYET:
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

COSTARD:
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.

MARIA:
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.

COSTARD:
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.

BOYET:
I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.

COSTARD:
By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
vulgar wit!
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
were, so fit.
Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
will swear!
And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
Sola, sola!

SIR NATHANIEL:
Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
of a good conscience.

HOLOFERNES:
The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
the soil, the land, the earth.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.

HOLOFERNES:
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

DULL:
'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES:
Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
insert again my haud credo for a deer.

DULL:
I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES:
Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!

SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
the duller parts:
And such barren plants are set before us, that we
thankful should be,
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he.
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

DULL:
You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
weeks old as yet?

HOLOFERNES:
Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.

DULL:
What is Dictynna?

SIR NATHANIEL:
A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

HOLOFERNES:
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
And raught not to five weeks when he came to
five-score.
The allusion holds in the exchange.

DULL:
'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.

HOLOFERNES:
God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
in the exchange.

DULL:
And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.

HOLOFERNES:
Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility.

HOLOFERNES:
I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
pleasing pricket;
Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
sore with shooting.
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
from thicket;
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel.
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

SIR NATHANIEL:
A rare talent!

DULL:

HOLOFERNES:
This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
thankful for it.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.

HOLOFERNES:
Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.

JAQUENETTA:
God give you good morrow, master Parson.

HOLOFERNES:
Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
pierced, which is the one?

COSTARD:
Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.

HOLOFERNES:
Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.

JAQUENETTA:
Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.

HOLOFERNES:
Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
Venetia, Venetia,
Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?

SIR NATHANIEL:
Ay, sir, and very learned.

HOLOFERNES:
Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.

SIR NATHANIEL:

HOLOFERNES:
You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
was this directed to you?

JAQUENETTA:
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
queen's lords.

HOLOFERNES:
I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.

JAQUENETTA:
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!

COSTARD:
Have with thee, my girl.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--

HOLOFERNES:
Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
colours. But to return to the verses: did they
please you, Sir Nathaniel?

SIR NATHANIEL:
Marvellous well for the pen.

HOLOFERNES:
I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
beseech your society.

SIR NATHANIEL:
And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
the happiness of life.

HOLOFERNES:
And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
their game, and we will to our recreation.

BIRON:
The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
with a paper: God give him grace to groan!

FERDINAND:
Ay me!

BIRON:

FERDINAND:

BIRON:
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!

LONGAVILLE:
Ay me, I am forsworn!

BIRON:
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.

FERDINAND:
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!

BIRON:
One drunkard loves another of the name.

LONGAVILLE:
Am I the first that have been perjured so?

BIRON:
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

LONGAVILLE:
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.

BIRON:
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.

LONGAVILLE:
This same shall go.
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To lose an oath to win a paradise?

BIRON:
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

LONGAVILLE:
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.

BIRON:
All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

DUMAIN:
O most divine Kate!

BIRON:
O most profane coxcomb!

DUMAIN:
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

BIRON:
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

DUMAIN:
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.

BIRON:
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

DUMAIN:
As upright as the cedar.

BIRON:
Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.

DUMAIN:
As fair as day.

BIRON:
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

DUMAIN:
O that I had my wish!

LONGAVILLE:
And I had mine!

FERDINAND:
And I mine too, good Lord!

BIRON:
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

DUMAIN:
I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.

BIRON:
A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

DUMAIN:
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

BIRON:
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

DUMAIN:

LONGAVILLE:

FERDINAND:

BIRON:
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!

FERDINAND:
Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

BIRON:
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?

FERDINAND:
Soft! whither away so fast?
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

BIRON:
I post from love: good lover, let me go.

JAQUENETTA:
God bless the king!

FERDINAND:
What present hast thou there?

COSTARD:
Some certain treason.

FERDINAND:
What makes treason here?

COSTARD:
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

FERDINAND:
If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.

JAQUENETTA:
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.

FERDINAND:
Biron, read it over.
Where hadst thou it?

JAQUENETTA:
Of Costard.

FERDINAND:
Where hadst thou it?

COSTARD:
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

FERDINAND:
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?

BIRON:
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

LONGAVILLE:
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.

DUMAIN:
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.

BIRON:

FERDINAND:
What?

BIRON:
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

DUMAIN:
Now the number is even.

BIRON:
True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?

FERDINAND:
Hence, sirs; away!

COSTARD:
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

BIRON:
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

FERDINAND:
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

BIRON:
Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?

FERDINAND:
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.

BIRON:
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

FERDINAND:
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

BIRON:
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.

FERDINAND:
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

BIRON:
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

DUMAIN:
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

LONGAVILLE:
And since her time are colliers counted bright.

FERDINAND:
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

DUMAIN:
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

BIRON:
Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

FERDINAND:
'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

BIRON:
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

FERDINAND:
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

DUMAIN:
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

LONGAVILLE:
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

BIRON:
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

DUMAIN:
O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

FERDINAND:
But what of this? are we not all in love?

BIRON:
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

FERDINAND:
Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

DUMAIN:
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

LONGAVILLE:
O, some authority how to proceed;
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.

DUMAIN:
Some salve for perjury.

BIRON:
'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfills the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

FERDINAND:
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

BIRON:
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.

LONGAVILLE:
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

FERDINAND:
And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.

BIRON:
First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

FERDINAND:
Away, away! no time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

BIRON:
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

HOLOFERNES:
Satis quod sufficit.

SIR NATHANIEL:
I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES:
Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

SIR NATHANIEL:
A most singular and choice epithet.

HOLOFERNES:
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Laus Deo, bene intelligo.

HOLOFERNES:
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
'twill serve.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Videsne quis venit?

HOLOFERNES:
Video, et gaudeo.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Chirrah!

HOLOFERNES:
Quare chirrah, not sirrah?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Men of peace, well encountered.

HOLOFERNES:
Most military sir, salutation.

MOTH:

COSTARD:
O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
for thou art not so long by the head as
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
swallowed than a flap-dragon.

MOTH:
Peace! the peal begins.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:

MOTH:
Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?

HOLOFERNES:
Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.

MOTH:
Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.

HOLOFERNES:
Quis, quis, thou consonant?

MOTH:
The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
the fifth, if I.

HOLOFERNES:
I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--

MOTH:
The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!

MOTH:
Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.

HOLOFERNES:
What is the figure? what is the figure?

MOTH:
Horns.

HOLOFERNES:
Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.

MOTH:
Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.

COSTARD:
An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
ends, as they say.

HOLOFERNES:
O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
charge-house on the top of the mountain?

HOLOFERNES:
Or mons, the hill.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

HOLOFERNES:
I do, sans question.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES:
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
assure you, sir, I do assure.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES:
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Nine Worthies.

SIR NATHANIEL:
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?

HOLOFERNES:
Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
page, Hercules,--

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.

HOLOFERNES:
Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.

MOTH:
An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For the rest of the Worthies?--

HOLOFERNES:
I will play three myself.

MOTH:
Thrice-worthy gentleman!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Shall I tell you a thing?

HOLOFERNES:
We attend.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
beseech you, follow.

HOLOFERNES:
Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.

DULL:
Nor understood none neither, sir.

HOLOFERNES:
Allons! we will employ thee.

DULL:
I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

HOLOFERNES:
Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!

PRINCESS:
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in:
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.

ROSALINE:
Madame, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS:
Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE:
That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.

KATHARINE:
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.

ROSALINE:
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.

KATHARINE:
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

ROSALINE:
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

KATHARINE:
A light condition in a beauty dark.

ROSALINE:
We need more light to find your meaning out.

KATHARINE:
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

ROSALINE:
Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.

KATHARINE:
So do not you, for you are a light wench.

ROSALINE:
Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

KATHARINE:
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.

ROSALINE:
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

PRINCESS:
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
Who sent it? and what is it?

ROSALINE:
I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great; be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

PRINCESS:
Any thing like?

ROSALINE:
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

PRINCESS:
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.

KATHARINE:
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

ROSALINE:
'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O, that your face were not so full of O's!

KATHARINE:
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.

PRINCESS:
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?

KATHARINE:
Madam, this glove.

PRINCESS:
Did he not send you twain?

KATHARINE:
Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.

MARIA:
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.

PRINCESS:
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?

MARIA:
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

PRINCESS:
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

ROSALINE:
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.

PRINCESS:
None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

ROSALINE:
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

MARIA:
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

PRINCESS:
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.

BOYET:
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

PRINCESS:
Thy news Boyet?

BOYET:
Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

PRINCESS:
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.

BOYET:
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out,
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.

PRINCESS:
But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET:
They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS:
And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
And change your favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.

ROSALINE:
Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE:
But in this changing what is your intent?

PRINCESS:
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.

ROSALINE:
But shall we dance, if they desire to't?

PRINCESS:
No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET:
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS:
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.

BOYET:
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.

MOTH:
All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--

BOYET:
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

MOTH:
A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!

BIRON:

MOTH:
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--

BOYET:
True; out indeed.

MOTH:
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
Not to behold--

BIRON:

MOTH:
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
--with your sun-beamed eyes--

BOYET:
They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

MOTH:
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.

BIRON:
Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!

ROSALINE:
What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
That some plain man recount their purposes
Know what they would.

BOYET:
What would you with the princess?

BIRON:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE:
What would they, say they?

BOYET:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE:
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

BOYET:
She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

FERDINAND:
Say to her, we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET:
They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.

ROSALINE:
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told.

BOYET:
If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BIRON:
Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET:
She hears herself.

ROSALINE:
How many weary steps,
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?

BIRON:
We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.

ROSALINE:
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

FERDINAND:
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

ROSALINE:
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

FERDINAND:
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.

ROSALINE:
Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.

FERDINAND:
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

ROSALINE:
You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.

FERDINAND:
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

ROSALINE:
Our ears vouchsafe it.

FERDINAND:
But your legs should do it.

ROSALINE:
Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.

FERDINAND:
Why take we hands, then?

ROSALINE:
Only to part friends:
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

FERDINAND:
More measure of this measure; be not nice.

ROSALINE:
We can afford no more at such a price.

FERDINAND:
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?

ROSALINE:
Your absence only.

FERDINAND:
That can never be.

ROSALINE:
Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.

FERDINAND:
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

ROSALINE:
In private, then.

FERDINAND:
I am best pleased with that.

BIRON:
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS:
Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

BIRON:
Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half-a-dozen sweets.

PRINCESS:
Seventh sweet, adieu:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BIRON:
One word in secret.

PRINCESS:
Let it not be sweet.

BIRON:
Thou grievest my gall.

PRINCESS:
Gall! bitter.

BIRON:
Therefore meet.

DUMAIN:
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

MARIA:
Name it.

DUMAIN:
Fair lady,--

MARIA:
Say you so? Fair lord,--
Take that for your fair lady.

DUMAIN:
Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

KATHARINE:
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

LONGAVILLE:
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

KATHARINE:
O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.

LONGAVILLE:
You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHARINE:
Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

LONGAVILLE:
A calf, fair lady!

KATHARINE:
No, a fair lord calf.

LONGAVILLE:
Let's part the word.

KATHARINE:
No, I'll not be your half
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE:
Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.

KATHARINE:
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE:
One word in private with you, ere I die.

KATHARINE:
Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.

BOYET:
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

ROSALINE:
Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

BIRON:
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

FERDINAND:
Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

PRINCESS:
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?

BOYET:
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

ROSALINE:
Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

PRINCESS:
O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.

ROSALINE:
O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.

PRINCESS:
Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

MARIA:
Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

KATHARINE:
Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he called me?

PRINCESS:
Qualm, perhaps.

KATHARINE:
Yes, in good faith.

PRINCESS:
Go, sickness as thou art!

ROSALINE:
Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.

PRINCESS:
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.

KATHARINE:
And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA:
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET:
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.

PRINCESS:
Will they return?

BOYET:
They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

PRINCESS:
How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.

BOYET:
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

PRINCESS:
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
If they return in their own shapes to woo?

ROSALINE:
Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.

BOYET:
Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

PRINCESS:
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

FERDINAND:
Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?

BOYET:
Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?

FERDINAND:
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

BOYET:
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.

BIRON:
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

FERDINAND:
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
That put Armado's page out of his part!

BIRON:
See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?

FERDINAND:
All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

PRINCESS:
'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

FERDINAND:
Construe my speeches better, if you may.

PRINCESS:
Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

FERDINAND:
We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

PRINCESS:
This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.

FERDINAND:
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

PRINCESS:
You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.

FERDINAND:
O, you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

PRINCESS:
Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.

FERDINAND:
How, madam! Russians!

PRINCESS:
Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

ROSALINE:
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

BIRON:
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

ROSALINE:
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--

BIRON:
I am a fool, and full of poverty.

ROSALINE:
But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

BIRON:
O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

ROSALINE:
All the fool mine?

BIRON:
I cannot give you less.

ROSALINE:
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

BIRON:
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

ROSALINE:
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

FERDINAND:
We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.

DUMAIN:
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.

PRINCESS:
Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?

ROSALINE:
Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

BIRON:
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE:
Sans sans, I pray you.

BIRON:
Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

PRINCESS:
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

BIRON:
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

ROSALINE:
It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

BIRON:
Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

ROSALINE:
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

BIRON:
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

FERDINAND:
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse.

PRINCESS:
The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?

FERDINAND:
Madam, I was.

PRINCESS:
And were you well advised?

FERDINAND:
I was, fair madam.

PRINCESS:
When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

FERDINAND:
That more than all the world I did respect her.

PRINCESS:
When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.

FERDINAND:
Upon mine honour, no.

PRINCESS:
Peace, peace! forbear:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

FERDINAND:
Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.

PRINCESS:
I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

ROSALINE:
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

PRINCESS:
God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honourably doth unhold his word.

FERDINAND:
What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
I never swore this lady such an oath.

ROSALINE:
By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.

FERDINAND:
My faith and this the princess I did give:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS:
Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?

BIRON:
Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET:
Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BIRON:
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, they would know
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.

BIRON:
What, are there but three?

COSTARD:
No, sir; but it is vara fine,
For every one pursents three.

BIRON:
And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD:
Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--

BIRON:
Is not nine.

COSTARD:
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BIRON:
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
by reckoning, sir.

BIRON:
How much is it?

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.

BIRON:
Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD:
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.

BIRON:
Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD:
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
some care.

FERDINAND:
Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.

BIRON:
We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

FERDINAND:
I say they shall not come.

PRINCESS:
Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things labouring perish in their birth.

BIRON:
A right description of our sport, my lord.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.

PRINCESS:
Doth this man serve God?

BIRON:
Why ask you?

PRINCESS:
He speaks not like a man of God's making.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

FERDINAND:
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
These four will change habits, and present the other five.

BIRON:
There is five in the first show.

FERDINAND:
You are deceived; 'tis not so.

BIRON:
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
and the boy:--
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

FERDINAND:
The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--

BOYET:
You lie, you are not he.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--

BOYET:
With libbard's head on knee.

BIRON:
Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
with thee.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--

DUMAIN:
The Great.

COSTARD:
It is, 'Great,' sir:--
Pompey surnamed the Great;
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
my foe to sweat:
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

PRINCESS:
Great thanks, great Pompey.

COSTARD:
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
made a little fault in 'Great.'

BIRON:
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.

SIR NATHANIEL:
When in the world I lived, I was the world's
commander;
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
conquering might:
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--

BOYET:
Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.

BIRON:
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

PRINCESS:
The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.

SIR NATHANIEL:
When in the world I lived, I was the world's
commander,--

BOYET:
Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

BIRON:
Pompey the Great,--

COSTARD:
Your servant, and Costard.

BIRON:
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD:

HOLOFERNES:
Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
Ergo I come with this apology.
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
Judas I am,--

DUMAIN:
A Judas!

HOLOFERNES:
Not Iscariot, sir.
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.

DUMAIN:
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

BIRON:
A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

HOLOFERNES:
Judas I am,--

DUMAIN:
The more shame for you, Judas.

HOLOFERNES:
What mean you, sir?

BOYET:
To make Judas hang himself.

HOLOFERNES:
Begin, sir; you are my elder.

BIRON:
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

HOLOFERNES:
I will not be put out of countenance.

BIRON:
Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES:
What is this?

BOYET:
A cittern-head.

DUMAIN:
The head of a bodkin.

BIRON:
A Death's face in a ring.

LONGAVILLE:
The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

BOYET:
The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

DUMAIN:
The carved-bone face on a flask.

BIRON:
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN:
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BIRON:
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

HOLOFERNES:
You have put me out of countenance.

BIRON:
False; we have given thee faces.

HOLOFERNES:
But you have out-faced them all.

BIRON:
An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

BOYET:
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

DUMAIN:
For the latter end of his name.

BIRON:
For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

HOLOFERNES:
This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.

BOYET:
A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.

PRINCESS:
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!

BIRON:
Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.

DUMAIN:
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

FERDINAND:
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

BOYET:
But is this Hector?

FERDINAND:
I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.

LONGAVILLE:
His leg is too big for Hector's.

DUMAIN:
More calf, certain.

BOYET:
No; he is best endued in the small.

BIRON:
This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN:
He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
Gave Hector a gift,--

DUMAIN:
A gilt nutmeg.

BIRON:
A lemon.

LONGAVILLE:
Stuck with cloves.

DUMAIN:
No, cloven.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Peace!--
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
I am that flower,--

DUMAIN:
That mint.

LONGAVILLE:
That columbine.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

LONGAVILLE:
I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.

DUMAIN:
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.

PRINCESS:
Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

BOYET:

DUMAIN:

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--

COSTARD:
The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
is two months on her way.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What meanest thou?

COSTARD:
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
her belly already: tis yours.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
die.

COSTARD:
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
him.

DUMAIN:
Most rare Pompey!

BOYET:
Renowned Pompey!

BIRON:
Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
Pompey the Huge!

DUMAIN:
Hector trembles.

BIRON:
Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
on! stir them on!

DUMAIN:
Hector will challenge him.

BIRON:
Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
sup a flea.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By the north pole, I do challenge thee.

COSTARD:
I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
let me borrow my arms again.

DUMAIN:
Room for the incensed Worthies!

COSTARD:
I'll do it in my shirt.

DUMAIN:
Most resolute Pompey!

MOTH:
Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
you? You will lose your reputation.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
in my shirt.

DUMAIN:
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.

BIRON:
What reason have you for't?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
woolward for penance.

BOYET:
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
his heart for a favour.

MERCADE:
God save you, madam!

PRINCESS:
Welcome, Mercade;
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.

MERCADE:
I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--

PRINCESS:
Dead, for my life!

MERCADE:
Even so; my tale is told.

BIRON:
Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.

FERDINAND:
How fares your majesty?

PRINCESS:
Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.

FERDINAND:
Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.

PRINCESS:
Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

FERDINAND:
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed,
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

PRINCESS:
I understand you not: my griefs are double.

BIRON:
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

PRINCESS:
We have received your letters full of love;
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time:
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.

DUMAIN:
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

LONGAVILLE:
So did our looks.

ROSALINE:
We did not quote them so.

FERDINAND:
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.

PRINCESS:
A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial and last love;
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither entitled in the other's heart.

FERDINAND:
If this, or more than this, I would deny,
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.

BIRON:
[And what to me, my love? and what to me?

ROSALINE:
You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
You are attaint with faults and perjury:
Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
But seek the weary beds of people sick.]

DUMAIN:
But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?

KATHARINE:
A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.

DUMAIN:
O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?

KATHARINE:
Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

DUMAIN:
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

KATHARINE:
Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

LONGAVILLE:
What says Maria?

MARIA:
At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

LONGAVILLE:
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

MARIA:
The liker you; few taller are so young.

BIRON:
Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.

ROSALINE:
Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

BIRON:
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

ROSALINE:
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal;
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.

BIRON:
A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

PRINCESS:

FERDINAND:
No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

BIRON:
Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.

FERDINAND:
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
And then 'twill end.

BIRON:
That's too long for a play.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--

PRINCESS:
Was not that Hector?

DUMAIN:
The worthy knight of Troy.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.

FERDINAND:
Call them forth quickly; we will do so.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Holla! approach.
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.
When daisies pied and violets blue
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
Apollo. You that way: we this way.

RODERIGO:
Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

IAGO:
'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

RODERIGO:
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

IAGO:
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
'I have already chose my officer.'
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

RODERIGO:
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

IAGO:
Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.

RODERIGO:
I would not follow him then.

IAGO:
O, sir, content you;
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

RODERIGO:
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
If he can carry't thus!

IAGO:
Call up her father,
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
As it may lose some colour.

RODERIGO:
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

IAGO:
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.

RODERIGO:
What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

IAGO:
Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
Thieves! thieves!

BRABANTIO:
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?

RODERIGO:
Signior, is all your family within?

IAGO:
Are your doors lock'd?

BRABANTIO:
Why, wherefore ask you this?

IAGO:
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
your gown;
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise, I say.

BRABANTIO:
What, have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO:
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO:
Not I what are you?

RODERIGO:
My name is Roderigo.

BRABANTIO:
The worser welcome:
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.

RODERIGO:
Sir, sir, sir,--

BRABANTIO:
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.

RODERIGO:
Patience, good sir.

BRABANTIO:
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
My house is not a grange.

RODERIGO:
Most grave Brabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

IAGO:
'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

BRABANTIO:
What profane wretch art thou?

IAGO:
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

BRABANTIO:
Thou art a villain.

IAGO:
You are--a senator.

BRABANTIO:
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

RODERIGO:
Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Transported, with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
If this be known to you and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.

BRABANTIO:
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream:
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say! light!

IAGO:
Farewell; for I must leave you:
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
However this may gall him with some cheque,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none,
To lead their business: in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
Yet, for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

BRABANTIO:
It is too true an evil: gone she is;
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

RODERIGO:
Truly, I think they are.

BRABANTIO:
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?

RODERIGO:
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

BRABANTIO:
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO:
I think I can discover him, if you please,
To get good guard and go along with me.

BRABANTIO:
Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

IAGO:
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

OTHELLO:
'Tis better as it is.

IAGO:
Nay, but he prated,
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honour
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
That the magnifico is much beloved,
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Will give him cable.

OTHELLO:
Let him do his spite:
My services which I have done the signiory
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

IAGO:
Those are the raised father and his friends:
You were best go in.

OTHELLO:
Not I I must be found:
My parts, my title and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

IAGO:
By Janus, I think no.

OTHELLO:
The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?

CASSIO:
The duke does greet you, general,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.

OTHELLO:
What is the matter, think you?

CASSIO:
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels,
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the duke's already: you have been
hotly call'd for;
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate hath sent about three several guests
To search you out.

OTHELLO:
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house,
And go with you.

CASSIO:
Ancient, what makes he here?

IAGO:
'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

CASSIO:
I do not understand.

IAGO:
He's married.

CASSIO:
To who?

IAGO:
Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

OTHELLO:
Have with you.

CASSIO:
Here comes another troop to seek for you.

IAGO:
It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
He comes to bad intent.

OTHELLO:
Holla! stand there!

RODERIGO:
Signior, it is the Moor.

BRABANTIO:
Down with him, thief!

IAGO:
You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

OTHELLO:
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Good signior, you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons.

BRABANTIO:
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunned
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.

OTHELLO:
Hold your hands,
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?

BRABANTIO:
To prison, till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.

OTHELLO:
What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
Whose messengers are here about my side,
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him?

First Officer:
'Tis true, most worthy signior;
The duke's in council and your noble self,
I am sure, is sent for.

BRABANTIO:
How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

DUKE OF VENICE:
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit.

First Senator:
Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

DUKE OF VENICE:
And mine, a hundred and forty.

Second Senator:
And mine, two hundred:
But though they jump not on a just account,--
As in these cases, where the aim reports,
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
I do not so secure me in the error,
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense.

Sailor:

First Officer:
A messenger from the galleys.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Now, what's the business?

Sailor:
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo.

DUKE OF VENICE:
How say you by this change?

First Senator:
This cannot be,
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
And let ourselves again but understand,
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
So may he with more facile question bear it,
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
But altogether lacks the abilities
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
To leave that latest which concerns him first,
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
To wake and wage a danger profitless.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

First Officer:
Here is more news.

Messenger:
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

First Senator:
Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

Messenger:
Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
With his free duty recommends you thus,
And prays you to believe him.

DUKE OF VENICE:
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

First Senator:
He's now in Florence.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

First Senator:
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman.
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

BRABANTIO:
So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Take hold on me, for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Why, what's the matter?

BRABANTIO:
My daughter! O, my daughter!

DUKE OF VENICE:
Dead?

BRABANTIO:
Ay, to me;
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.

BRABANTIO:
Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate for the state-affairs
Hath hither brought.

DUKE OF VENICE:
We are very sorry for't.

DUKE OF VENICE:

BRABANTIO:
Nothing, but this is so.

OTHELLO:
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her:
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration and what mighty magic,
For such proceeding I am charged withal,
I won his daughter.

BRABANTIO:
A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
To find out practises of cunning hell,
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.

DUKE OF VENICE:
To vouch this, is no proof,
Without more wider and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

First Senator:
But, Othello, speak:
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?

OTHELLO:
I do beseech you,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
And let her speak of me before her father:
If you do find me foul in her report,
The trust, the office I do hold of you,
Not only take away, but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Fetch Desdemona hither.

OTHELLO:
Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
And she in mine.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Say it, Othello.

OTHELLO:
Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have passed.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history:
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story.
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

DUKE OF VENICE:
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,
Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands.

BRABANTIO:
I pray you, hear her speak:
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA:
My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.

BRABANTIO:
God be wi' you! I have done.
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor:
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
I am glad at soul I have no other child:
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
Into your favour.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

BRABANTIO:
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

DUKE OF VENICE:
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
known to you; and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

OTHELLO:
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness, and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
I crave fit disposition for my wife.
Due reference of place and exhibition,
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding.

DUKE OF VENICE:
If you please,
Be't at her father's.

BRABANTIO:
I'll not have it so.

OTHELLO:
Nor I.

DESDEMONA:
Nor I; I would not there reside,
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

DUKE OF VENICE:
What would You, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA:
That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honour and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

OTHELLO:
Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
To please the palate of my appetite,
Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments,
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation!

DUKE OF VENICE:
Be it as you shall privately determine,
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
And speed must answer it.

First Senator:
You must away to-night.

OTHELLO:
With all my heart.

DUKE OF VENICE:
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
And he shall our commission bring to you;
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.

OTHELLO:
So please your grace, my ancient;
A man he is of honest and trust:
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Let it be so.
Good night to every one.
And, noble signior,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

First Senator:
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

BRABANTIO:
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

OTHELLO:
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

RODERIGO:
Iago,--

IAGO:
What say'st thou, noble heart?

RODERIGO:
What will I do, thinkest thou?

IAGO:
Why, go to bed, and sleep.

RODERIGO:
I will incontinently drown myself.

IAGO:
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
thou silly gentleman!

RODERIGO:
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

IAGO:
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
times seven years; and since I could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
would change my humanity with a baboon.

RODERIGO:
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

IAGO:
Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
distract it with many, either to have it sterile
with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
you call love to be a sect or scion.

RODERIGO:
It cannot be.

IAGO:
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
she will find the error of her choice: she must
have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her.

RODERIGO:
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
the issue?

IAGO:
Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
of this to-morrow. Adieu.

RODERIGO:
Where shall we meet i' the morning?

IAGO:
At my lodging.

RODERIGO:
I'll be with thee betimes.

IAGO:
Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

RODERIGO:
What say you?

IAGO:
No more of drowning, do you hear?

RODERIGO:
I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

IAGO:
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
If I would time expend with such a snipe.
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected, framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

MONTANO:
What from the cape can you discern at sea?

First Gentleman:
Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
Descry a sail.

MONTANO:
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

Second Gentleman:
A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
seems to cast water on the burning bear,
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood.

MONTANO:
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
It is impossible they bear it out.

Third Gentleman:
News, lads! our wars are done.
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet.

MONTANO:
How! is this true?

Third Gentleman:
The ship is here put in,
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

MONTANO:
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

Third Gentleman:
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest.

MONTANO:
Pray heavens he be;
For I have served him, and the man commands
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
As well to see the vessel that's come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard.

Third Gentleman:
Come, let's do so:
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance.

CASSIO:
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements,
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

MONTANO:
Is he well shipp'd?

CASSIO:
His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
Stand in bold cure.

CASSIO:
What noise?

Fourth Gentleman:
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

CASSIO:
My hopes do shape him for the governor.

Second Gentlemen:
They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
Our friends at least.

CASSIO:
I pray you, sir, go forth,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

Second Gentleman:
I shall.

MONTANO:
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

CASSIO:
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.
How now! who has put in?

Second Gentleman:
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

CASSIO:
Has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona.

MONTANO:
What is she?

CASSIO:
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort!
O, behold,
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA:
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO:
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

DESDEMONA:
O, but I fear--How lost you company?

CASSIO:
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

Second Gentleman:
They give their greeting to the citadel;
This likewise is a friend.

CASSIO:
See for the news.
Good ancient, you are welcome.
Welcome, mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

IAGO:
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You'll have enough.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, she has no speech.

IAGO:
In faith, too much;
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
And chides with thinking.

EMILIA:
You have little cause to say so.

IAGO:
Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

DESDEMONA:
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

IAGO:
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
You rise to play and go to bed to work.

EMILIA:
You shall not write my praise.

IAGO:
No, let me not.

DESDEMONA:
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
praise me?

IAGO:
O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
For I am nothing, if not critical.

DESDEMONA:
Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

IAGO:
Ay, madam.

DESDEMONA:
I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

IAGO:
I am about it; but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
The one's for use, the other useth it.

DESDEMONA:
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

IAGO:
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

DESDEMONA:
Worse and worse.

EMILIA:
How if fair and foolish?

IAGO:
She never yet was foolish that was fair;
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

DESDEMONA:
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
her that's foul and foolish?

IAGO:
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

DESDEMONA:
O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

IAGO:
She that was ever fair and never proud,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
See suitors following and not look behind,
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

DESDEMONA:
To do what?

IAGO:
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

DESDEMONA:
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor?

CASSIO:
He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar.

IAGO:

CASSIO:
'Tis truly so.

DESDEMONA:
Let's meet him and receive him.

CASSIO:
Lo, where he comes!

OTHELLO:
O my fair warrior!

DESDEMONA:
My dear Othello!

OTHELLO:
It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.

DESDEMONA:
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!

OTHELLO:
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content;
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this, and this, the greatest discords be
That e'er our hearts shall make!

IAGO:

OTHELLO:
Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Once more, well met at Cyprus.

IAGO:
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them--list me. The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
directly in love with him.

RODERIGO:
With him! why, 'tis not possible.

IAGO:
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
and will she love him still for prating? let not
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does? a knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
hath found him already.

RODERIGO:
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
most blessed condition.

IAGO:
Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
not mark that?

RODERIGO:
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

IAGO:
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister.

RODERIGO:
Well.

IAGO:
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
impediment most profitably removed, without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

RODERIGO:
I will do this, if I can bring it to any
opportunity.

IAGO:
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

RODERIGO:
Adieu.

IAGO:
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
For making him egregiously an ass
And practising upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

Herald:
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!

OTHELLO:
Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
Not to outsport discretion.

CASSIO:
Iago hath direction what to do;
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to't.

OTHELLO:
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you.
Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.

CASSIO:
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

IAGO:
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.

CASSIO:
She's a most exquisite lady.

IAGO:
And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

CASSIO:
Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

IAGO:
What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation.

CASSIO:
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

IAGO:
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO:
She is indeed perfection.

IAGO:
Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

CASSIO:
Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.

IAGO:
O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
you.

CASSIO:
I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
and dare not task my weakness with any more.

IAGO:
What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
desire it.

CASSIO:
Where are they?

IAGO:
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

CASSIO:
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

IAGO:
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
That hold their honours in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

CASSIO:
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

MONTANO:
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
a soldier.

IAGO:
Some wine, ho!
And let me the canakin clink, clink;
And let me the canakin clink
A soldier's a man;
A life's but a span;
Why, then, let a soldier drink.
Some wine, boys!

CASSIO:
'Fore God, an excellent song.

IAGO:
I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
to your English.

CASSIO:
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

IAGO:
Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
can be filled.

CASSIO:
To the health of our general!

MONTANO:
I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

IAGO:
O sweet England!
King Stephen was a worthy peer,
His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear,
With that he call'd the tailor lown.
He was a wight of high renown,
And thou art but of low degree:
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
Some wine, ho!

CASSIO:
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

IAGO:
Will you hear't again?

CASSIO:
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

IAGO:
It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO:
For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.

IAGO:
And so do I too, lieutenant.

CASSIO:
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
speak well enough.

All:
Excellent well.

CASSIO:
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

MONTANO:
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.

IAGO:
You see this fellow that is gone before;
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction: and do but see his vice;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
On some odd time of his infirmity,
Will shake this island.

MONTANO:
But is he often thus?

IAGO:
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
He'll watch the horologe a double set,
If drink rock not his cradle.

MONTANO:
It were well
The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

IAGO:

MONTANO:
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity:
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor.

IAGO:
Not I, for this fair island:
I do love Cassio well; and would do much
To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?

CASSIO:
You rogue! you rascal!

MONTANO:
What's the matter, lieutenant?

CASSIO:
A knave teach me my duty!
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

RODERIGO:
Beat me!

CASSIO:
Dost thou prate, rogue?

MONTANO:
Nay, good lieutenant;
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

CASSIO:
Let me go, sir,
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

MONTANO:
Come, come,
you're drunk.

CASSIO:
Drunk!

IAGO:

OTHELLO:
What is the matter here?

MONTANO:
'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

OTHELLO:
Hold, for your lives!

IAGO:
Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

OTHELLO:
Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

IAGO:
I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
As if some planet had unwitted men--
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

OTHELLO:
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

CASSIO:
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

OTHELLO:
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted, and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

MONTANO:
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
While I spare speech, which something now
offends me,--
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night;
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.

OTHELLO:
Now, by heaven,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
And passion, having my best judgment collied,
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on;
And he that is approved in this offence,
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

MONTANO:
If partially affined, or leagued in office,
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
Thou art no soldier.

IAGO:
Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help:
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
For this was brief--I found them close together,
At blow and thrust; even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity,
Which patience could not pass.

OTHELLO:
I know, Iago,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
But never more be officer of mine.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.

DESDEMONA:
What's the matter?

OTHELLO:
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
Lead him off.
Iago, look with care about the town,
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

IAGO:
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

CASSIO:
Ay, past all surgery.

IAGO:
Marry, heaven forbid!

CASSIO:
Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!

IAGO:
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again, and he's yours.

CASSIO:
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
let us call thee devil!

IAGO:
What was he that you followed with your sword? What
had he done to you?

CASSIO:
I know not.

IAGO:
Is't possible?

CASSIO:
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

IAGO:
Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered?

CASSIO:
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another, to make me frankly despise myself.

IAGO:
Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
the place, and the condition of this country
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

CASSIO:
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

IAGO:
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

CASSIO:
I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

IAGO:
You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

CASSIO:
You advise me well.

IAGO:
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

CASSIO:
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

IAGO:
You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
must to the watch.

CASSIO:
Good night, honest Iago.

IAGO:
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.
How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO:
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

IAGO:
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
Nay, get thee gone.
Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay.

CASSIO:
Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'

Clown:
Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
that they speak i' the nose thus?

First Musician:
How, sir, how!

Clown:
Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

First Musician:
Ay, marry, are they, sir.

Clown:
O, thereby hangs a tail.

First Musician:
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

Clown:
Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
sake, to make no more noise with it.

First Musician:
Well, sir, we will not.

Clown:
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
again: but, as they say to hear music the general
does not greatly care.

First Musician:
We have none such, sir.

Clown:
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
go; vanish into air; away!

CASSIO:
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

Clown:
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

CASSIO:
Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this?

Clown:
She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
shall seem to notify unto her.

CASSIO:
Do, good my friend.
In happy time, Iago.

IAGO:
You have not been a-bed, then?

CASSIO:
Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.

IAGO:
I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.

CASSIO:
I humbly thank you for't.
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.

EMILIA:
Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.

CASSIO:
Yet, I beseech you,
If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.

EMILIA:
Pray you, come in;
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.

CASSIO:
I am much bound to you.

OTHELLO:
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.

IAGO:
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

OTHELLO:
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

Gentleman:
We'll wait upon your lordship.

DESDEMONA:
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.

EMILIA:
Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
As if the case were his.

DESDEMONA:
O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

CASSIO:
Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

DESDEMONA:
I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.

CASSIO:
Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

DESDEMONA:
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

EMILIA:
Madam, here comes my lord.

CASSIO:
Madam, I'll take my leave.

DESDEMONA:
Why, stay, and hear me speak.

CASSIO:
Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
Unfit for mine own purposes.

DESDEMONA:
Well, do your discretion.

IAGO:
Ha! I like not that.

OTHELLO:
What dost thou say?

IAGO:
Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

OTHELLO:
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

IAGO:
Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.

OTHELLO:
I do believe 'twas he.

DESDEMONA:
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

OTHELLO:
Who is't you mean?

DESDEMONA:
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

OTHELLO:
Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA:
Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

OTHELLO:
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

DESDEMONA:
But shall't be shortly?

OTHELLO:
The sooner, sweet, for you.

DESDEMONA:
Shall't be to-night at supper?

OTHELLO:
No, not to-night.

DESDEMONA:
To-morrow dinner, then?

OTHELLO:
I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.

DESDEMONA:
Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

OTHELLO:
Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.

DESDEMONA:
Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.

OTHELLO:
I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.

DESDEMONA:
Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

OTHELLO:
Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

DESDEMONA:
Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

OTHELLO:
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.

IAGO:
My noble lord--

OTHELLO:
What dost thou say, Iago?

IAGO:
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?

OTHELLO:
He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

IAGO:
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.

OTHELLO:
Why of thy thought, Iago?

IAGO:
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

OTHELLO:
O, yes; and went between us very oft.

IAGO:
Indeed!

OTHELLO:
Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

IAGO:
Honest, my lord!

OTHELLO:
Honest! ay, honest.

IAGO:
My lord, for aught I know.

OTHELLO:
What dost thou think?

IAGO:
Think, my lord!

OTHELLO:
Think, my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.

IAGO:
My lord, you know I love you.

OTHELLO:
I think thou dost;
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
They are close delations, working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.

IAGO:
For Michael Cassio,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO:
I think so too.

IAGO:
Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO:
Certain, men should be what they seem.

IAGO:
Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

OTHELLO:
Nay, yet there's more in this:
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.

IAGO:
Good my lord, pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?

OTHELLO:
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.

IAGO:
I do beseech you--
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.

OTHELLO:
What dost thou mean?

IAGO:
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.

OTHELLO:
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

IAGO:
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

OTHELLO:
Ha!

IAGO:
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO:
O misery!

IAGO:
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!

OTHELLO:
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO:
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature,
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

OTHELLO:
Dost thou say so?

IAGO:
She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.

OTHELLO:
And so she did.

IAGO:
Why, go to then;
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.

OTHELLO:
I am bound to thee for ever.

IAGO:
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

OTHELLO:
Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO:
I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.

OTHELLO:
I will not.

IAGO:
Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
My lord, I see you're moved.

OTHELLO:
No, not much moved:
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

IAGO:
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

OTHELLO:
And yet, how nature erring from itself,--

IAGO:
Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent.

OTHELLO:
Farewell, farewell:
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

IAGO:

OTHELLO:
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

IAGO:

OTHELLO:
Fear not my government.

IAGO:
I once more take my leave.

OTHELLO:
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.

DESDEMONA:
How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

OTHELLO:
I am to blame.

DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

OTHELLO:
I have a pain upon my forehead here.

DESDEMONA:
'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

OTHELLO:
Your napkin is too little:
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

DESDEMONA:
I am very sorry that you are not well.

EMILIA:
I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

IAGO:
How now! what do you here alone?

EMILIA:
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

IAGO:
A thing for me? it is a common thing--

EMILIA:
Ha!

IAGO:
To have a foolish wife.

EMILIA:
O, is that all? What will you give me now
For the same handkerchief?

IAGO:
What handkerchief?

EMILIA:
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
That which so often you did bid me steal.

IAGO:
Hast stol'n it from her?

EMILIA:
No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
Look, here it is.

IAGO:
A good wench; give it me.

EMILIA:
What will you do with 't, that you have been
so earnest
To have me filch it?

IAGO:

EMILIA:
If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

IAGO:
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
And let him find it. Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
But with a little act upon the blood.
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
Look, where he comes!
Not poppy, nor mandragora,
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday.

OTHELLO:
Ha! ha! false to me?

IAGO:
Why, how now, general! no more of that.

OTHELLO:
Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.

IAGO:
How now, my lord!

OTHELLO:
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

IAGO:
I am sorry to hear this.

OTHELLO:
I had been happy, if the general camp,
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

IAGO:
Is't possible, my lord?

OTHELLO:
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!

IAGO:
Is't come to this?

OTHELLO:
Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

IAGO:
My noble lord,--

OTHELLO:
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.

IAGO:
O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

OTHELLO:
Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

IAGO:
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
And loses that it works for.

OTHELLO:
By the world,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

IAGO:
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?

OTHELLO:
Would! nay, I will.

IAGO:
And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
Behold her topp'd?

OTHELLO:
Death and damnation! O!

IAGO:
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

OTHELLO:
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

IAGO:
I do not like the office:
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

OTHELLO:
O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO:
Nay, this was but his dream.

OTHELLO:
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

IAGO:
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.

OTHELLO:
I'll tear her all to pieces.

IAGO:
Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

OTHELLO:
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

IAGO:
I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
See Cassio wipe his beard with.

OTHELLO:
If it be that--

IAGO:
If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.

OTHELLO:
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

IAGO:
Yet be content.

OTHELLO:
O, blood, blood, blood!

IAGO:
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

OTHELLO:
Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.

IAGO:
Do not rise yet.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.

OTHELLO:
I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.

IAGO:
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.

OTHELLO:
Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

IAGO:
I am your own for ever.

DESDEMONA:
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

Clown:
I dare not say he lies any where.

DESDEMONA:
Why, man?

Clown:
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
is stabbing.

DESDEMONA:
Go to: where lodges he?

Clown:
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA:
Can any thing be made of this?

Clown:
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
to lie in mine own throat.

DESDEMONA:
Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Clown:
I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
questions, and by them answer.

DESDEMONA:
Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

Clown:
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it.

DESDEMONA:
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA:
I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA:
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA:
Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA:
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.

EMILIA:
Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA:
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
How is't with you, my lord

OTHELLO:
Well, my good lady.
O, hardness to dissemble!--
How do you, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA:
Well, my good lord.

OTHELLO:
Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

DESDEMONA:
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

OTHELLO:
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout;
For here's a young and sweating devil here,
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.

DESDEMONA:
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

OTHELLO:
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

DESDEMONA:
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

OTHELLO:
What promise, chuck?

DESDEMONA:
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

OTHELLO:
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.

DESDEMONA:
Here, my lord.

OTHELLO:
That which I gave you.

DESDEMONA:
I have it not about me.

OTHELLO:
Not?

DESDEMONA:
No, indeed, my lord.

OTHELLO:
That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.

DESDEMONA:
Is't possible?

OTHELLO:
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.

DESDEMONA:
Indeed! is't true?

OTHELLO:
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

DESDEMONA:
Then would to God that I had never seen't!

OTHELLO:
Ha! wherefore?

DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO:
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
o' the way?

DESDEMONA:
Heaven bless us!

OTHELLO:
Say you?

DESDEMONA:
It is not lost; but what an if it were?

OTHELLO:
How!

DESDEMONA:
I say, it is not lost.

OTHELLO:
Fetch't, let me see't.

DESDEMONA:
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

OTHELLO:
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

DESDEMONA:
Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA:
I pray, talk me of Cassio.

OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA:
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you,--

OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA:
In sooth, you are to blame.

OTHELLO:
Away!

EMILIA:
Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA:
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA:
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

IAGO:
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

DESDEMONA:
How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

CASSIO:
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

IAGO:
Is my lord angry?

EMILIA:
He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

IAGO:
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

DESDEMONA:
I prithee, do so.
Something, sure, of state,
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.

EMILIA:
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

DESDEMONA:
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

EMILIA:
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

DESDEMONA:
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA:
Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA:
I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

CASSIO:
I humbly thank your ladyship.

BIANCA:
Save you, friend Cassio!

CASSIO:
What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

BIANCA:
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!

CASSIO:
Pardon me, Bianca:
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
But I shall, in a more continuate time,
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
Take me this work out.

BIANCA:
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend:
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO:
Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, Bianca.

BIANCA:
Why, whose is it?

CASSIO:
I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

BIANCA:
Leave you! wherefore?

CASSIO:
I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

BIANCA:
Why, I pray you?

CASSIO:
Not that I love you not.

BIANCA:
But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.

CASSIO:
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

BIANCA:
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

IAGO:
Will you think so?

OTHELLO:
Think so, Iago!

IAGO:
What,
To kiss in private?

OTHELLO:
An unauthorized kiss.

IAGO:
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO:
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil:
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

IAGO:
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

OTHELLO:
What then?

IAGO:
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

OTHELLO:
She is protectress of her honour too:
May she give that?

IAGO:
Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not:
But, for the handkerchief,--

OTHELLO:
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

IAGO:
Ay, what of that?

OTHELLO:
That's not so good now.

IAGO:
What,
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
Who having, by their own importunate suit,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
But they must blab--

OTHELLO:
Hath he said any thing?

IAGO:
He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO:
What hath he said?

IAGO:
'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

OTHELLO:
What? what?

IAGO:
Lie--

OTHELLO:
With her?

IAGO:
With her, on her; what you will.

OTHELLO:
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction. It is not words
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--

IAGO:
Work on,
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!
How now, Cassio!

CASSIO:
What's the matter?

IAGO:
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

CASSIO:
Rub him about the temples.

IAGO:
No, forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course:
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
He will recover straight: when he is gone,
I would on great occasion speak with you.
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

OTHELLO:
Dost thou mock me?

IAGO:
I mock you! no, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO:
A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO:
There's many a beast then in a populous city,
And many a civil monster.

OTHELLO:
Did he confess it?

IAGO:
Good sir, be a man;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you: there's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO:
O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

IAGO:
Stand you awhile apart;
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
A passion most unsuiting such a man--
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.

OTHELLO:
Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

IAGO:
That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

CASSIO:
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.

IAGO:
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
How quickly should you speed!

CASSIO:
Alas, poor caitiff!

OTHELLO:
Look, how he laughs already!

IAGO:
I never knew woman love man so.

CASSIO:
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

OTHELLO:
Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

IAGO:
Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO:
Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

IAGO:
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
Do you intend it?

CASSIO:
Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO:
Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

CASSIO:
I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO:
So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

IAGO:
'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

CASSIO:
Prithee, say true.

IAGO:
I am a very villain else.

OTHELLO:
Have you scored me? Well.

CASSIO:
This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
flattery, not out of my promise.

OTHELLO:
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

CASSIO:
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

OTHELLO:
Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
imports it.

CASSIO:
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO:
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
throw it to.

CASSIO:
Well, I must leave her company.

IAGO:
Before me! look, where she comes.

CASSIO:
'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA:
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

CASSIO:
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

OTHELLO:
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

BIANCA:
An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
will not, come when you are next prepared for.

IAGO:
After her, after her.

CASSIO:
'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

IAGO:
Will you sup there?

CASSIO:
'Faith, I intend so.

IAGO:
Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
speak with you.

CASSIO:
Prithee, come; will you?

IAGO:
Go to; say no more.

OTHELLO:

IAGO:
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO:
O Iago!

IAGO:
And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO:
Was that mine?

IAGO:
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
hath given it his whore.

OTHELLO:
I would have him nine years a-killing.
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

IAGO:
Nay, you must forget that.

OTHELLO:
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
an emperor's side and command him tasks.

IAGO:
Nay, that's not your way.

OTHELLO:
Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
and plenteous wit and invention:--

IAGO:
She's the worse for all this.

OTHELLO:
O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
gentle a condition!

IAGO:
Ay, too gentle.

OTHELLO:
Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

IAGO:
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
near nobody.

OTHELLO:
I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

IAGO:
O, 'tis foul in her.

OTHELLO:
With mine officer!

IAGO:
That's fouler.

OTHELLO:
Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

IAGO:
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
the bed she hath contaminated.

OTHELLO:
Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.

IAGO:
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
shall hear more by midnight.

OTHELLO:
Excellent good.
What trumpet is that same?

IAGO:
Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

LODOVICO:
Save you, worthy general!

OTHELLO:
With all my heart, sir.

LODOVICO:
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

OTHELLO:
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

DESDEMONA:
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

IAGO:
I am very glad to see you, signior
Welcome to Cyprus.

LODOVICO:
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

IAGO:
Lives, sir.

DESDEMONA:
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

OTHELLO:
Are you sure of that?

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

OTHELLO:

LODOVICO:
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

DESDEMONA:
A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

OTHELLO:
Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

OTHELLO:
Are you wise?

DESDEMONA:
What, is he angry?

LODOVICO:
May be the letter moved him;
For, as I think, they do command him home,
Deputing Cassio in his government.

DESDEMONA:
Trust me, I am glad on't.

OTHELLO:
Indeed!

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

OTHELLO:
I am glad to see you mad.

DESDEMONA:
Why, sweet Othello,--

OTHELLO:

DESDEMONA:
I have not deserved this.

LODOVICO:
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
Make her amends; she weeps.

OTHELLO:
O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!

DESDEMONA:
I will not stay to offend you.

LODOVICO:
Truly, an obedient lady:
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

OTHELLO:
Mistress!

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

OTHELLO:
What would you with her, sir?

LODOVICO:
Who, I, my lord?

OTHELLO:
Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
I do entreat that we may sup together:
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!

LODOVICO:
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO:
He is much changed.

LODOVICO:
Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

IAGO:
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not,
I would to heaven he were!

LODOVICO:
What, strike his wife!

IAGO:
'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst!

LODOVICO:
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood,
And new-create this fault?

IAGO:
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech: do but go after,
And mark how he continues.

LODOVICO:
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

OTHELLO:
You have seen nothing then?

EMILIA:
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

OTHELLO:
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

EMILIA:
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

OTHELLO:
What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA:
Never, my lord.

OTHELLO:
Nor send you out o' the way?

EMILIA:
Never.

OTHELLO:
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA:
Never, my lord.

OTHELLO:
That's strange.

EMILIA:
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

OTHELLO:
Bid her come hither: go.
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

DESDEMONA:
My lord, what is your will?

OTHELLO:
Pray, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA:
What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO:
Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.

DESDEMONA:
What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO:

DESDEMONA:
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words.
But not the words.

OTHELLO:
Why, what art thou?

DESDEMONA:
Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.

OTHELLO:
Come, swear it, damn thyself
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA:
Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO:
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA:
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

OTHELLO:
O Desdemona! away! away! away!

DESDEMONA:
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

OTHELLO:
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live, or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA:
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

OTHELLO:
O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
ne'er been born!

DESDEMONA:
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO:
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
And will not hear it. What committed!
Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA:
By heaven, you do me wrong.

OTHELLO:
Are you not a strumpet?

DESDEMONA:
No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO:
What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA:
No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO:
Is't possible?

DESDEMONA:
O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO:
I cry you mercy, then:
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello.
You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
You, you, ay, you!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

EMILIA:
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA:
'Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA:
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA:
With who?

EMILIA:
Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA:
Who is thy lord?

EMILIA:
He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA:
I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA:
Here's a change indeed!

DESDEMONA:
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

IAGO:
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is't with you?

DESDEMONA:
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

IAGO:
What's the matter, lady?

EMILIA:
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA:
Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO:
What name, fair lady?

DESDEMONA:
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA:
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

IAGO:
Why did he so?

DESDEMONA:
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

IAGO:
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

EMILIA:
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA:
It is my wretched fortune.

IAGO:
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA:
Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA:
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

IAGO:
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

DESDEMONA:
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA:
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

IAGO:
Speak within door.

EMILIA:
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

IAGO:
You are a fool; go to.

DESDEMONA:
O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

IAGO:
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
The business of the state does him offence,
And he does chide with you.

DESDEMONA:
If 'twere no other--

IAGO:
'Tis but so, I warrant.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO:
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

IAGO:
What in the contrary?

RODERIGO:
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered.

IAGO:
Will you hear me, Roderigo?

RODERIGO:
'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
performances are no kin together.

IAGO:
You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO:
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
my means. The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

IAGO:
Well; go to; very well.

RODERIGO:
Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
to find myself fobbed in it.

IAGO:
Very well.

RODERIGO:
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
will seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO:
You have said now.

RODERIGO:
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

IAGO:
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

RODERIGO:
It hath not appeared.

IAGO:
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life.

RODERIGO:
Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

IAGO:
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO:
Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice.

IAGO:
O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

RODERIGO:
How do you mean, removing of him?

IAGO:
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
knocking out his brains.

RODERIGO:
And that you would have me to do?

IAGO:
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
to waste: about it.

RODERIGO:
I will hear further reason for this.

IAGO:
And you shall be satisfied.

LODOVICO:
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

OTHELLO:
O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

LODOVICO:
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

DESDEMONA:
Your honour is most welcome.

OTHELLO:
Will you walk, sir?
O,--Desdemona,--

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

OTHELLO:
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

DESDEMONA:
I will, my lord.

EMILIA:
How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

DESDEMONA:
He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.

EMILIA:
Dismiss me!

DESDEMONA:
It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
We must not now displease him.

EMILIA:
I would you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA:
So would not I my love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

EMILIA:
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

DESDEMONA:
All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
In one of those same sheets.

EMILIA:
Come, come you talk.

DESDEMONA:
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it: that song to-night
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
But to go hang my head all at one side,
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

EMILIA:
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA:
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.

EMILIA:
A very handsome man.

DESDEMONA:
He speaks well.

EMILIA:
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA:

EMILIA:
It's the wind.

DESDEMONA:

EMILIA:
'Tis neither here nor there.

DESDEMONA:
I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?

EMILIA:
There be some such, no question.

DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA:
Why, would not you?

DESDEMONA:
No, by this heavenly light!

EMILIA:
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.

DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA:
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
For a small vice.

DESDEMONA:
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

EMILIA:
In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

DESDEMONA:
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

EMILIA:
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
own world, and you might quickly make it right.

DESDEMONA:
I do not think there is any such woman.

EMILIA:
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

DESDEMONA:
Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

IAGO:
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.

RODERIGO:
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

IAGO:
Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

RODERIGO:
I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

IAGO:
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.

RODERIGO:
I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!

CASSIO:
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st
I will make proof of thine.

RODERIGO:
O, I am slain!

CASSIO:
I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

OTHELLO:
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

RODERIGO:
O, villain that I am!

OTHELLO:
It is even so.

CASSIO:
O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

OTHELLO:
'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

CASSIO:
What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

GRATIANO:
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

CASSIO:
O, help!

LODOVICO:
Hark!

RODERIGO:
O wretched villain!

LODOVICO:
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
To come in to the cry without more help.

RODERIGO:
Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

LODOVICO:
Hark!

GRATIANO:
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

IAGO:
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

LODOVICO:
We do not know.

IAGO:
Did not you hear a cry?

CASSIO:
Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

IAGO:
What's the matter?

GRATIANO:
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

LODOVICO:
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

IAGO:
What are you here that cry so grievously?

CASSIO:
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.

IAGO:
O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

CASSIO:
I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.

IAGO:
O treacherous villains!
What are you there? come in, and give some help.

RODERIGO:
O, help me here!

CASSIO:
That's one of them.

IAGO:
O murderous slave! O villain!

RODERIGO:
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

IAGO:
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
What may you be? are you of good or evil?

LODOVICO:
As you shall prove us, praise us.

IAGO:
Signior Lodovico?

LODOVICO:
He, sir.

IAGO:
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

GRATIANO:
Cassio!

IAGO:
How is't, brother!

CASSIO:
My leg is cut in two.

IAGO:
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

BIANCA:
What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

IAGO:
Who is't that cried!

BIANCA:
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO:
O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
Who they should be that have thus many led you?

CASSIO:
No.

GRATIANO:
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

IAGO:
Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
To bear him easily hence!

BIANCA:
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO:
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

GRATIANO:
What, of Venice?

IAGO:
Even he, sir; did you know him?

GRATIANO:
Know him! ay.

IAGO:
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
That so neglected you.

GRATIANO:
I am glad to see you.

IAGO:
How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

GRATIANO:
Roderigo!

IAGO:
He, he 'tis he.
O, that's well said; the chair!

GRATIANO:
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
For you, mistress,
Save you your labour. He that lies slain
here, Cassio,
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

CASSIO:
None in the world; nor do I know the man.

IAGO:

EMILIA:
'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

IAGO:
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

EMILIA:
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

IAGO:
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
What, do you shake at that?

BIANCA:
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

IAGO:
O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

EMILIA:
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

BIANCA:
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.

EMILIA:
As I! foh! fie upon thee!

IAGO:
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
Will you go on? I pray.
This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

OTHELLO:
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light:
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore,
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
I cannot give it vital growth again.
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

DESDEMONA:
Who's there? Othello?

OTHELLO:
Ay. Desdemona.

DESDEMONA:
Will you come to bed, my lord?

OTHELLO:
Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA:
Ay, my lord.

OTHELLO:
If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

OTHELLO:
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

DESDEMONA:
Talk you of killing?

OTHELLO:
Ay, I do.

DESDEMONA:
Then heaven
Have mercy on me!

OTHELLO:
Amen, with all my heart!

DESDEMONA:
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

OTHELLO:
Hum!

DESDEMONA:
And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

OTHELLO:
Think on thy sins.

DESDEMONA:
They are loves I bear to you.

OTHELLO:
Ay, and for that thou diest.

DESDEMONA:
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

OTHELLO:
Peace, and be still!

DESDEMONA:
I will so. What's the matter?

OTHELLO:
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio.

DESDEMONA:
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

OTHELLO:
Sweet soul, take heed,
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

DESDEMONA:
Ay, but not yet to die.

OTHELLO:
Yes, presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

DESDEMONA:
Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO:
I say, amen.

DESDEMONA:
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love: I never gave him token.

OTHELLO:
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
I saw the handkerchief.

DESDEMONA:
He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

OTHELLO:
He hath confess'd.

DESDEMONA:
What, my lord?

OTHELLO:
That he hath used thee.

DESDEMONA:
How? unlawfully?

OTHELLO:
Ay.

DESDEMONA:
He will not say so.

OTHELLO:
No, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

DESDEMONA:
O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

OTHELLO:
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
Had stomach for them all.

DESDEMONA:
Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

OTHELLO:
Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

DESDEMONA:
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

OTHELLO:
Down, strumpet!

DESDEMONA:
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

OTHELLO:
Nay, if you strive--

DESDEMONA:
But half an hour!

OTHELLO:
Being done, there is no pause.

DESDEMONA:
But while I say one prayer!

OTHELLO:
It is too late.

EMILIA:

OTHELLO:
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

EMILIA:

OTHELLO:
Who's there?

EMILIA:

OTHELLO:
Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
O insupportable! O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration.

EMILIA:

OTHELLO:
I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
What's the matter with thee now?

EMILIA:
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

OTHELLO:
What, now?

EMILIA:
But now, my lord.

OTHELLO:
It is the very error of the moon;
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
And makes men mad.

EMILIA:
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.

OTHELLO:
Roderigo kill'd!
And Cassio kill'd!

EMILIA:
No, Cassio is not kill'd.

OTHELLO:
Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

DESDEMONA:
O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

EMILIA:
Alas, what cry is that?

OTHELLO:
That! what?

EMILIA:
Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA:
A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA:
O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA:
Nobody; I myself. Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

OTHELLO:
Why, how should she be murder'd?

EMILIA:
Alas, who knows?

OTHELLO:
You heard her say herself, it was not I.

EMILIA:
She said so: I must needs report the truth.

OTHELLO:
She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
'Twas I that kill'd her.

EMILIA:
O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!

OTHELLO:
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

EMILIA:
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

OTHELLO:
She was false as water.

EMILIA:
Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

OTHELLO:
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

EMILIA:
My husband!

OTHELLO:
Thy husband.

EMILIA:
That she was false to wedlock?

OTHELLO:
Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
I'ld not have sold her for it.

EMILIA:
My husband!

OTHELLO:
Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds.

EMILIA:
My husband!

OTHELLO:
What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

EMILIA:
O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
My husband say that she was false!

OTHELLO:
He, woman;
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

EMILIA:
If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

OTHELLO:
Ha!

EMILIA:
Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.

OTHELLO:
Peace, you were best.

EMILIA:
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

MONTANO:
What is the matter? How now, general!

EMILIA:
O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

GRATIANO:
What is the matter?

EMILIA:
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
Speak, for my heart is full.

IAGO:
I told him what I thought, and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

EMILIA:
But did you ever tell him she was false?

IAGO:
I did.

EMILIA:
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

IAGO:
With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

EMILIA:
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

All:
O heavens forfend!

EMILIA:
And your reports have set the murder on.

OTHELLO:
Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

GRATIANO:
'Tis a strange truth.

MONTANO:
O monstrous act!

EMILIA:
Villany, villany, villany!
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
O villany, villany!

IAGO:
What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

EMILIA:
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

OTHELLO:
O! O! O!

EMILIA:
Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye.

OTHELLO:

GRATIANO:
Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
And fall to reprobation.

OTHELLO:
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
It was a handkerchief, an antique token
My father gave my mother.

EMILIA:
O heaven! O heavenly powers!

IAGO:
Come, hold your peace.

EMILIA:
'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

IAGO:
Be wise, and get you home.

EMILIA:
I will not.

GRATIANO:
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?

EMILIA:
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often, with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.

IAGO:
Villanous whore!

EMILIA:
She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
And I did give't my husband.

IAGO:
Filth, thou liest!

EMILIA:
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?

OTHELLO:
Are there no stones in heaven
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!

GRATIANO:
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

EMILIA:
Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

GRATIANO:
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

MONTANO:
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
For 'tis a damned slave.

OTHELLO:
I am not valiant neither,
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
But why should honour outlive honesty?
Let it go all.

EMILIA:
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
And die in music.
Willow, willow, willow,--
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.

OTHELLO:
I have another weapon in this chamber;
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

GRATIANO:

OTHELLO:
Look in upon me then and speak with me,
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

GRATIANO:
What is the matter?

OTHELLO:
Behold, I have a weapon;
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
That, with this little arm and this good sword,
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

LODOVICO:
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

OTHELLO:
That's he that was Othello: here I am.

LODOVICO:
Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

OTHELLO:
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

LODOVICO:
Wrench his sword from him.

IAGO:
I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

OTHELLO:
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

LODOVICO:
O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
What shall be said to thee?

OTHELLO:
Why, any thing:
An honourable murderer, if you will;
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

LODOVICO:
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

OTHELLO:
Ay.

CASSIO:
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

OTHELLO:
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

IAGO:
Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
From this time forth I never will speak word.

LODOVICO:
What, not to pray?

GRATIANO:
Torments will ope your lips.

OTHELLO:
Well, thou dost best.

LODOVICO:
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
And here another: the one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo.

OTHELLO:
O villain!

CASSIO:
Most heathenish and most gross!

LODOVICO:
Now here's another discontented paper,
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him.

OTHELLO:
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
That was my wife's?

CASSIO:
I found it in my chamber:
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.

OTHELLO:
O fool! fool! fool!

CASSIO:
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.

LODOVICO:
You must forsake this room, and go with us:
Your power and your command is taken off,
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long,
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

OTHELLO:
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
And smote him, thus.

LODOVICO:
O bloody period!

GRATIANO:
All that's spoke is marr'd.

OTHELLO:
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

CASSIO:
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
For he was great of heart.

LODOVICO:

KING HENRY IV:
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.

WESTMORELAND:
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butchered;
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.

KING HENRY IV:
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

WESTMORELAND:
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the north and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
At Holmedon met,
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
As by discharge of their artillery,
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
For he that brought them, in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse,
Uncertain of the issue any way.

KING HENRY IV:
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
And is not this an honourable spoil?
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

WESTMORELAND:
In faith,
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

KING HENRY IV:
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son,
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

WESTMORELAND:
This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
Malevolent to you in all aspects;
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity.

KING HENRY IV:
But I have sent for him to answer this;
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
But come yourself with speed to us again;
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered.

WESTMORELAND:
I will, my liege.

FALSTAFF:
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day.

FALSTAFF:
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
thou wilt have none,--

PRINCE HENRY:
What, none?

FALSTAFF:
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

FALSTAFF:
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
us that are squires of the night's body be called
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

PRINCE HENRY:
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

FALSTAFF:
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin?

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?

FALSTAFF:
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft.

PRINCE HENRY:
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?

FALSTAFF:
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
and where it would not, I have used my credit.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

PRINCE HENRY:
No; thou shalt.

FALSTAFF:
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.

FALSTAFF:
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
you.

PRINCE HENRY:
For obtaining of suits?

FALSTAFF:
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

PRINCE HENRY:
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
Moor-ditch?

FALSTAFF:
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
streets, and no man regards it.

FALSTAFF:
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
should speak truly, little better than one of the
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
Christendom.

PRINCE HENRY:
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?

FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
do not, call me villain and baffle me.

PRINCE HENRY:
I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
to purse-taking.

FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation.
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
a true man.

PRINCE HENRY:
Good morrow, Ned.

POINS:
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
and a cold capon's leg?

PRINCE HENRY:
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.

POINS:
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.

PRINCE HENRY:
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

POINS:
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
at home and be hanged.

FALSTAFF:
Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
I'll hang you for going.

POINS:
You will, chops?

FALSTAFF:
Hal, wilt thou make one?

PRINCE HENRY:
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.

FALSTAFF:
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.

FALSTAFF:
Why, that's well said.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.

PRINCE HENRY:
I care not.

POINS:
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go.

FALSTAFF:
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed, that the
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.

PRINCE HENRY:
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!

POINS:
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
yourself and I will not be there; and when they
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
this head off from my shoulders.

PRINCE HENRY:
How shall we part with them in setting forth?

POINS:
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.

PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
horses, by our habits and by every other
appointment, to be ourselves.

POINS:
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.

POINS:
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
lies the jest.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
there I'll sup. Farewell.

POINS:
Farewell, my lord.

PRINCE HENRY:
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyoked humour of your idleness:
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world,
That, when he please again to be himself,
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays,
To sport would be as tedious as to work;
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
So, when this loose behavior I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised,
By how much better than my word I am,
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
Redeeming time when men think least I will.

KING HENRY IV:
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
And you have found me; for accordingly
You tread upon my patience: but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord.--

KING HENRY IV:
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us: when we need
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
You were about to speak.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yea, my good lord.
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
As is deliver'd to your majesty:
Either envy, therefore, or misprison
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.

HOTSPUR:
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
But I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
He was perfumed like a milliner;
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose and took't away again;
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience,
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
He should or he should not; for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
And I beseech you, let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
To such a person and in such a place,
At such a time, with all the rest retold,
May reasonably die and never rise
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said, so he unsay it now.

KING HENRY IV:
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
But with proviso and exception,
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

HOTSPUR:
Revolted Mortimer!
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
But by the chance of war; to prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
In single opposition, hand to hand,
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
Three times they breathed and three times did
they drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
Nor could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many, and all willingly:
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.

KING HENRY IV:
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
He never did encounter with Glendower:
I tell thee,
He durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
We licence your departure with your son.
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

HOTSPUR:
An if the devil come and roar for them,
I will not send them: I will after straight
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
Here comes your uncle.

HOTSPUR:
Speak of Mortimer!
'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful king,
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

HOTSPUR:
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
He was; I heard the proclamation:
And then it was when the unhappy king,
--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
Upon his Irish expedition;
From whence he intercepted did return
To be deposed and shortly murdered.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.

HOTSPUR:
But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
He did; myself did hear it.

HOTSPUR:
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
But shall it be that you, that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
That you a world of curses undergo,
Being the agents, or base second means,
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
O, pardon me that I descend so low,
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtle king;
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again,
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
Of this proud king, who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
Therefore, I say--

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Peace, cousin, say no more:
And now I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

HOTSPUR:
If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
Send danger from the east unto the west,
So honour cross it from the north to south,
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

HOTSPUR:
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival, all her dignities:
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

EARL OF WORCESTER:
He apprehends a world of figures here,
But not the form of what he should attend.
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

HOTSPUR:
I cry you mercy.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners,--

HOTSPUR:
I'll keep them all;
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
I'll keep them, by this hand.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
Those prisoners you shall keep.

HOTSPUR:
Nay, I will; that's flat:
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
But I will find him when he lies asleep,
And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
Nay,
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear you, cousin; a word.

HOTSPUR:
All studies here I solemnly defy,
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance,
I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
When you are better temper'd to attend.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

HOTSPUR:
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
'Sblood!--
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
At Berkley castle.

HOTSPUR:
You say true:
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Nay, if you have not, to it again;
We will stay your leisure.

HOTSPUR:
I have done, i' faith.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written, be assured,
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
The archbishop.

HOTSPUR:
Of York, is it not?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
True; who bears hard
His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
I speak not this in estimation,
As what I think might be, but what I know
Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

HOTSPUR:
I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.

HOTSPUR:
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
And then the power of Scotland and of York,
To join with Mortimer, ha?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And so they shall.

HOTSPUR:
In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
To save our heads by raising of a head;
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
The king will always think him in our debt,
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.

HOTSPUR:
He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.

HOTSPUR:
Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

First Carrier:
Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!

Ostler:

First Carrier:
I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
of all cess.

Second Carrier:
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.

First Carrier:
Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
rose; it was the death of him.

Second Carrier:
I think this be the most villanous house in all
London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.

First Carrier:
Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
christen could be better bit than I have been since
the first cock.

Second Carrier:
Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
fleas like a loach.

First Carrier:
What, ostler! come away and be hanged!

Second Carrier:
I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

First Carrier:
God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
hast thou no faith in thee?

GADSHILL:
Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?

First Carrier:
I think it be two o'clock.

GADSHILL:
I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
in the stable.

First Carrier:
Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.

GADSHILL:
I pray thee, lend me thine.

Second Carrier:
Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.

GADSHILL:
Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?

Second Carrier:
Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
gentleman: they will along with company, for they
have great charge.

GADSHILL:
What, ho! chamberlain!

Chamberlain:

GADSHILL:
That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
thou layest the plot how.

Chamberlain:
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
they will away presently.

GADSHILL:
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
clerks, I'll give thee this neck.

Chamberlain:
No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
as truly as a man of falsehood may.

GADSHILL:
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
content to do the profession some grace; that would,
if matters should be looked into, for their own
credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
her their boots.

Chamberlain:
What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
out water in foul way?

GADSHILL:
She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
of fern-seed, we walk invisible.

Chamberlain:
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.

GADSHILL:
Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
purchase, as I am a true man.

Chamberlain:
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.

GADSHILL:
Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
you muddy knave.

POINS:
Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.

PRINCE HENRY:
Stand close.

FALSTAFF:
Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!

PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
thou keep!

FALSTAFF:
Where's Poins, Hal?

PRINCE HENRY:
He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.

FALSTAFF:
I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
of travellers.

FALSTAFF:
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

FALSTAFF:
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
good king's son.

PRINCE HENRY:
Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?

FALSTAFF:
Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

GADSHILL:
Stand.

FALSTAFF:
So I do, against my will.

POINS:
O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
what news?

BARDOLPH:
Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
to the king's exchequer.

FALSTAFF:
You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.

GADSHILL:
There's enough to make us all.

FALSTAFF:
To be hanged.

PRINCE HENRY:
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
from your encounter, then they light on us.

PETO:
How many be there of them?

GADSHILL:
Some eight or ten.

FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, will they not rob us?

PRINCE HENRY:
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

FALSTAFF:
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
but yet no coward, Hal.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, we leave that to the proof.

POINS:
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
Farewell, and stand fast.

FALSTAFF:
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

PRINCE HENRY:
Ned, where are our disguises?

POINS:
Here, hard by: stand close.

FALSTAFF:
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
every man to his business.

First Traveller:
Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.

Thieves:
Stand!

Travellers:
Jesus bless us!

FALSTAFF:
Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.

Travellers:
O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!

FALSTAFF:
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.

PRINCE HENRY:
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
and a good jest for ever.

POINS:
Stand close; I hear them coming.

FALSTAFF:
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

PRINCE HENRY:
Your money!

POINS:
Villains!

PRINCE HENRY:
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.

POINS:
How the rogue roar'd!

HOTSPUR:
'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
friends true and constant: a good plot, good
friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
next month? and are they not some of them set
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
forward to-night.
How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.

LADY PERCY:
O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
And I must know it, else he loves me not.

HOTSPUR:
What, ho!
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

Servant:
He is, my lord, an hour ago.

HOTSPUR:
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?

Servant:
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

HOTSPUR:
What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?

Servant:
It is, my lord.

HOTSPUR:
That roan shall by my throne.
Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.

LADY PERCY:
But hear you, my lord.

HOTSPUR:
What say'st thou, my lady?

LADY PERCY:
What is it carries you away?

HOTSPUR:
Why, my horse, my love, my horse.

LADY PERCY:
Out, you mad-headed ape!
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
As you are toss'd with. In faith,
I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
About his title, and hath sent for you
To line his enterprise: but if you go,--

HOTSPUR:
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

LADY PERCY:
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
Directly unto this question that I ask:
In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.

HOTSPUR:
Away,
Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
have with me?

LADY PERCY:
Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

HOTSPUR:
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when I am on horseback, I will swear
I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
No lady closer; for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

LADY PERCY:
How! so far?

HOTSPUR:
Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
Will this content you, Kate?

LADY PERCY:
It must of force.

PRINCE HENRY:
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
thy hand to laugh a little.

POINS:
Where hast been, Hal?

PRINCE HENRY:
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
They take it already upon their salvation, that
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
am king of England, I shall command all the good
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
I'll show thee a precedent.

POINS:
Francis!

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou art perfect.

POINS:
Francis!

FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.

PRINCE HENRY:
Come hither, Francis.

FRANCIS:
My lord?

PRINCE HENRY:
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

FRANCIS:
Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--

POINS:

FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE HENRY:
Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
a fair pair of heels and run from it?

FRANCIS:
O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
England, I could find in my heart.

POINS:

FRANCIS:
Anon, sir.

PRINCE HENRY:
How old art thou, Francis?

FRANCIS:
Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--

POINS:

FRANCIS:
Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.

PRINCE HENRY:
Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?

FRANCIS:
O Lord, I would it had been two!

PRINCE HENRY:
I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.

POINS:

FRANCIS:
Anon, anon.

PRINCE HENRY:
Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
thou wilt. But, Francis!

FRANCIS:
My lord?

PRINCE HENRY:
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--

FRANCIS:
O Lord, sir, who do you mean?

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.

FRANCIS:
What, sir?

POINS:

PRINCE HENRY:
Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?

Vintner:
What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
calling? Look to the guests within.
My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
at the door: shall I let them in?

PRINCE HENRY:
Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
Poins!

POINS:
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE HENRY:
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
the door: shall we be merry?

POINS:
As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
cunning match have you made with this jest of the
drawer? come, what's the issue?

PRINCE HENRY:
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
What's o'clock, Francis?

FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE HENRY:
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.

POINS:
Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?

FALSTAFF:
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?

PRINCE HENRY:
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.

FALSTAFF:
You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
shotten herring. There live not three good men
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.

PRINCE HENRY:
How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?

FALSTAFF:
A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?

FALSTAFF:
Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?

POINS:
'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
Lord, I'll stab thee.

FALSTAFF:
I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
back: call you that backing of your friends? A
plague upon such backing! give me them that will
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
drunk to-day.

PRINCE HENRY:
O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
drunkest last.

FALSTAFF:
All's one for that.
A plague of all cowards, still say I.

PRINCE HENRY:
What's the matter?

FALSTAFF:
What's the matter! there be four of us here have
ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.

PRINCE HENRY:
Where is it, Jack? where is it?

FALSTAFF:
Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
poor four of us.

PRINCE HENRY:
What, a hundred, man?

FALSTAFF:
I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
through and through; my sword hacked like a
hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.

PRINCE HENRY:
Speak, sirs; how was it?

GADSHILL:
We four set upon some dozen--

FALSTAFF:
Sixteen at least, my lord.

GADSHILL:
And bound them.

PETO:
No, no, they were not bound.

FALSTAFF:
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

GADSHILL:
As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--

FALSTAFF:
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.

PRINCE HENRY:
What, fought you with them all?

FALSTAFF:
All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.

PRINCE HENRY:
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.

FALSTAFF:
Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--

PRINCE HENRY:
What, four? thou saidst but two even now.

FALSTAFF:
Four, Hal; I told thee four.

POINS:
Ay, ay, he said four.

FALSTAFF:
These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
points in my target, thus.

PRINCE HENRY:
Seven? why, there were but four even now.

FALSTAFF:
In buckram?

POINS:
Ay, four, in buckram suits.

FALSTAFF:
Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.

PRINCE HENRY:
Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear me, Hal?

PRINCE HENRY:
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.

FALSTAFF:
Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of--

PRINCE HENRY:
So, two more already.

FALSTAFF:
Their points being broken,--

POINS:
Down fell their hose.

FALSTAFF:
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
the eleven I paid.

PRINCE HENRY:
O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!

FALSTAFF:
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
not see thy hand.

PRINCE HENRY:
These lies are like their father that begets them;
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--

FALSTAFF:
What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
the truth?

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?

POINS:
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.

FALSTAFF:
What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
compulsion, I.

PRINCE HENRY:
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
this huge hill of flesh,--

FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
for breath to utter what is like thee! you
tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
standing-tuck,--

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
hear me speak but this.

POINS:
Mark, Jack.

PRINCE HENRY:
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
apparent shame?

POINS:
Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
merry? shall we have a play extempore?

PRINCE HENRY:
Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.

FALSTAFF:
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

Hostess:
O Jesu, my lord the prince!

PRINCE HENRY:
How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
me?

Hostess:
Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
door would speak with you: he says he comes from
your father.

PRINCE HENRY:
Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
send him back again to my mother.

FALSTAFF:
What manner of man is he?

Hostess:
An old man.

FALSTAFF:
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer?

PRINCE HENRY:
Prithee, do, Jack.

FALSTAFF:
'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

PRINCE HENRY:
Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
prince; no, fie!

BARDOLPH:
'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

PRINCE HENRY:
'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
sword so hacked?

PETO:
Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
swear truth out of England but he would make you
believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.

BARDOLPH:
Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices.

PRINCE HENRY:
O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
instinct hadst thou for it?

BARDOLPH:
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
these exhalations?

PRINCE HENRY:
I do.

BARDOLPH:
What think you they portend?

PRINCE HENRY:
Hot livers and cold purses.

BARDOLPH:
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

PRINCE HENRY:
No, if rightly taken, halter.
Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?

FALSTAFF:
My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
hook--what a plague call you him?

POINS:
O, Glendower.

FALSTAFF:
Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
perpendicular,--

PRINCE HENRY:
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
kills a sparrow flying.

FALSTAFF:
You have hit it.

PRINCE HENRY:
So did he never the sparrow.

FALSTAFF:
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
for running!

FALSTAFF:
O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.

PRINCE HENRY:
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

FALSTAFF:
I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.

FALSTAFF:
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
it?

PRINCE HENRY:
Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.

FALSTAFF:
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.

PRINCE HENRY:
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
particulars of my life.

FALSTAFF:
Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

PRINCE HENRY:
Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
crown for a pitiful bald crown!

FALSTAFF:
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
in King Cambyses' vein.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, here is my leg.

FALSTAFF:
And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.

Hostess:
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!

FALSTAFF:
Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.

Hostess:
O, the father, how he holds his countenance!

FALSTAFF:
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

Hostess:
O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
players as ever I see!

FALSTAFF:
Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

PRINCE HENRY:
What manner of man, an it like your majesty?

FALSTAFF:
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
thou been this month?

PRINCE HENRY:
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
and I'll play my father.

FALSTAFF:
Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.

PRINCE HENRY:
Well, here I am set.

FALSTAFF:
And here I stand: judge, my masters.

PRINCE HENRY:
Now, Harry, whence come you?

FALSTAFF:
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

PRINCE HENRY:
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
ye for a young prince, i' faith.

PRINCE HENRY:
Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?

FALSTAFF:
I would your grace would take me with you: whom
means your grace?

PRINCE HENRY:
That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.

FALSTAFF:
My lord, the man I know.

PRINCE HENRY:
I know thou dost.

FALSTAFF:
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

PRINCE HENRY:
I do, I will.

BARDOLPH:
O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
monstrous watch is at the door.

FALSTAFF:
Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

Hostess:
O Jesu, my lord, my lord!

PRINCE HENRY:
Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
what's the matter?

Hostess:
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
without seeming so.

PRINCE HENRY:
And thou a natural coward, without instinct.

FALSTAFF:
I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.

PRINCE HENRY:
Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
conscience.

FALSTAFF:
Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
therefore I'll hide me.

PRINCE HENRY:
Call in the sheriff.
Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?

Sheriff:
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.

PRINCE HENRY:
What men?

Sheriff:
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
A gross fat man.

Carrier:
As fat as butter.

PRINCE HENRY:
The man, I do assure you, is not here;
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For any thing he shall be charged withal:
And so let me entreat you leave the house.

Sheriff:
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.

PRINCE HENRY:
It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.

Sheriff:
Good night, my noble lord.

PRINCE HENRY:
I think it is good morrow, is it not?

Sheriff:
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.

PRINCE HENRY:
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
call him forth.

PETO:
Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
snorting like a horse.

PRINCE HENRY:
Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
What hast thou found?

PETO:
Nothing but papers, my lord.

PRINCE HENRY:
Let's see what they be: read them.

PETO:

PRINCE HENRY:
O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.

PETO:
Good morrow, good my lord.

MORTIMER:
These promises are fair, the parties sure,
And our induction full of prosperous hope.

HOTSPUR:
Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
Will you sit down?
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
I have forgot the map.

GLENDOWER:
No, here it is.
Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.

HOTSPUR:
And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.

GLENDOWER:
I cannot blame him: at my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Of burning cressets; and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward.

HOTSPUR:
Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
had never been born.

GLENDOWER:
I say the earth did shake when I was born.

HOTSPUR:
And I say the earth was not of my mind,
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.

GLENDOWER:
The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.

HOTSPUR:
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
And not in fear of your nativity.
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
In passion shook.

GLENDOWER:
Cousin, of many men
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men.
Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
And bring him out that is but woman's son
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments.

HOTSPUR:
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
I'll to dinner.

MORTIMER:
Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.

GLENDOWER:
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.

HOTSPUR:
Why, so can I, or so can any man;
But will they come when you do call for them?

GLENDOWER:
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
The devil.

HOTSPUR:
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!

MORTIMER:
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.

GLENDOWER:
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.

HOTSPUR:
Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?

GLENDOWER:
Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
According to our threefold order ta'en?

MORTIMER:
The archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally:
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
By south and east is to my part assign'd:
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
And all the fertile land within that bound,
To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
Which being sealed interchangeably,
A business that this night may execute,
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish power,
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
My father Glendower is not ready yet,
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
Within that space you may have drawn together
Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.

GLENDOWER:
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
For there will be a world of water shed
Upon the parting of your wives and you.

HOTSPUR:
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
In quantity equals not one of yours:
See how this river comes me cranking in,
And cuts me from the best of all my land
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
In a new channel, fair and evenly;
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.

GLENDOWER:
Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.

MORTIMER:
Yea, but
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
With like advantage on the other side;
Gelding the opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.

HOTSPUR:
I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.

GLENDOWER:
I'll not have it alter'd.

HOTSPUR:
Will not you?

GLENDOWER:
No, nor you shall not.

HOTSPUR:
Who shall say me nay?

GLENDOWER:
Why, that will I.

HOTSPUR:
Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.

GLENDOWER:
I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
For I was train'd up in the English court;
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
A virtue that was never seen in you.

HOTSPUR:
Marry,
And I am glad of it with all my heart:
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.

GLENDOWER:
Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.

HOTSPUR:
I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
To any well-deserving friend;
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?

GLENDOWER:
The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
I'll haste the writer and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence:
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.

MORTIMER:
Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!

HOTSPUR:
I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
And of a dragon and a finless fish,
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
He held me last night at least nine hours
In reckoning up the several devils' names
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
As a tired horse, a railing wife;
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
In any summer-house in Christendom.

MORTIMER:
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
Exceedingly well read, and profited
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
I warrant you, that man is not alive
Might so have tempted him as you have done,
Without the taste of danger and reproof:
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite beside his patience.
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
Defect of manners, want of government,
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
Beguiling them of commendation.

HOTSPUR:
Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.

MORTIMER:
This is the deadly spite that angers me;
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

GLENDOWER:
My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.

MORTIMER:
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.

GLENDOWER:
She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
one that no persuasion can do good upon.

MORTIMER:
I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
In such a parley should I answer thee.
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
And that's a feeling disputation:
But I will never be a truant, love,
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
With ravishing division, to her lute.

GLENDOWER:
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.

MORTIMER:
O, I am ignorance itself in this!

GLENDOWER:
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
As is the difference betwixt day and night
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
Begins his golden progress in the east.

MORTIMER:
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn

GLENDOWER:
Do so;
And those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.

HOTSPUR:
Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.

LADY PERCY:
Go, ye giddy goose.

HOTSPUR:
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
By'r lady, he is a good musician.

LADY PERCY:
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

HOTSPUR:
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.

LADY PERCY:
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?

HOTSPUR:
No.

LADY PERCY:
Then be still.

HOTSPUR:
Neither;'tis a woman's fault.

LADY PERCY:
Now God help thee!

HOTSPUR:
To the Welsh lady's bed.

LADY PERCY:
What's that?

HOTSPUR:
Peace! she sings.

HOTSPUR:
Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.

LADY PERCY:
Not mine, in good sooth.

HOTSPUR:
Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
'as sure as day,'
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
Come, sing.

LADY PERCY:
I will not sing.

HOTSPUR:
'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.

GLENDOWER:
Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
And then to horse immediately.

MORTIMER:
With all my heart.

KING HENRY IV:
Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
For we shall presently have need of you.
I know not whether God will have it so,
For some displeasing service I have done,
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Could such inordinate and low desires,
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
Such barren pleasures, rude society,
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
And hold their level with thy princely heart?

PRINCE HENRY:
So please your majesty, I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal:
Yet such extenuation let me beg,
As, in reproof of many tales devised,
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
Find pardon on my true submission.

KING HENRY IV:
God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood:
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment,
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dress'd myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Even in the presence of the crowned king.
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity.
The skipping king, he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance, against his name,
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative,
Grew a companion to the common streets,
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much.
So when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
As, sick and blunted with community,
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation: not an eye
But is a-weary of thy common sight,
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

PRINCE HENRY:
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
Be more myself.

KING HENRY IV:
For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
And even as I was then is Percy now.
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou the shadow of succession;
For of no right, nor colour like to right,
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
Capitulate against us and are up.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To fight against me under Percy's pay,
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.

PRINCE HENRY:
Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
That this same child of honour and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
For every honour sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
And I will call him to so strict account,
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This, in the name of God, I promise here:
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
I do beseech your majesty may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

KING HENRY IV:
A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
So hath the business that I come to speak of.
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
If promises be kept on every hand,
As ever offer'd foul play in the state.

KING HENRY IV:
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
For this advertisement is five days old:
On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
Our business valued, some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
Our hands are full of business: let's away;
Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
spoil of me.

BARDOLPH:
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.

FALSTAFF:
Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
of all compass.

BARDOLPH:
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
compass, Sir John.

FALSTAFF:
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
Knight of the Burning Lamp.

BARDOLPH:
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

FALSTAFF:
No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
for the light in thy face, the son of utter
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
it!

BARDOLPH:
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

FALSTAFF:
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
yet who picked my pocket?

Hostess:
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
was never lost in my house before.

FALSTAFF:
Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
to, you are a woman, go.

Hostess:
Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
called so in mine own house before.

FALSTAFF:
Go to, I know you well enough.

Hostess:
No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
you a dozen of shirts to your back.

FALSTAFF:
Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.

Hostess:
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
you, four and twenty pound.

FALSTAFF:
He had his part of it; let him pay.

Hostess:
He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.

FALSTAFF:
How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.

Hostess:
O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
how oft, that ring was copper!

FALSTAFF:
How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
would say so.
How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
must we all march?

BARDOLPH:
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

Hostess:
My lord, I pray you, hear me.

PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.

Hostess:
Good my lord, hear me.

FALSTAFF:
Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.

PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou, Jack?

FALSTAFF:
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
bawdy-house; they pick pockets.

PRINCE HENRY:
What didst thou lose, Jack?

FALSTAFF:
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
grandfather's.

PRINCE HENRY:
A trifle, some eight-penny matter.

Hostess:
So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
he would cudgel you.

PRINCE HENRY:
What! he did not?

Hostess:
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.

FALSTAFF:
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
go

Hostess:
Say, what thing? what thing?

FALSTAFF:
What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.

Hostess:
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
call me so.

FALSTAFF:
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
otherwise.

Hostess:
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

FALSTAFF:
What beast! why, an otter.

PRINCE HENRY:
An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?

FALSTAFF:
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
where to have her.

Hostess:
Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.

Hostess:
So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
ought him a thousand pound.

PRINCE HENRY:
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?

FALSTAFF:
A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
a million: thou owest me thy love.

Hostess:
Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
cudgel you.

FALSTAFF:
Did I, Bardolph?

BARDOLPH:
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, if he said my ring was copper.

PRINCE HENRY:
I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?

FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
roaring of a lion's whelp.

PRINCE HENRY:
And why not as the lion?

FALSTAFF:
The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
I do, I pray God my girdle break.

PRINCE HENRY:
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?

PRINCE HENRY:
It appears so by the story.

FALSTAFF:
Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
prithee, be gone.
Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
lad, how is that answered?

PRINCE HENRY:
O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
thee: the money is paid back again.

FALSTAFF:
O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.

PRINCE HENRY:
I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.

FALSTAFF:
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
do it with unwashed hands too.

BARDOLPH:
Do, my lord.

PRINCE HENRY:
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.

FALSTAFF:
I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
laud them, I praise them.

PRINCE HENRY:
Bardolph!

BARDOLPH:
My lord?

PRINCE HENRY:
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
o'clock in the afternoon.
There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
Money and order for their furniture.
The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
And either we or they must lower lie.

FALSTAFF:
Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!

HOTSPUR:
Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery,
Such attribution should the Douglas have,
As not a soldier of this season's stamp
Should go so general current through the world.
By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Thou art the king of honour:
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him.

HOTSPUR:
Do so, and 'tis well.
What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.

Messenger:
These letters come from your father.

HOTSPUR:
Letters from him! why comes he not himself?

Messenger:
He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.

HOTSPUR:
'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
Under whose government come they along?

Messenger:
His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

Messenger:
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much fear'd by his physicians.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited:
His health was never better worth than now.

HOTSPUR:
Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
The very life-blood of our enterprise;
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
He writes me here, that inward sickness--
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed but on his own.
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
That with our small conjunction we should on,
To see how fortune is disposed to us;
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
Because the king is certainly possess'd
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

HOTSPUR:
A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast? to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
It were not good; for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope,
The very list, the very utmost bound
Of all our fortunes.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
'Faith, and so we should;
Where now remains a sweet reversion:
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
Is to come in:
A comfort of retirement lives in this.

HOTSPUR:
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
If that the devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
But yet I would your father had been here.
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division: it will be thought
By some, that know not why he is away,
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction
And breed a kind of question in our cause;
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of.

HOTSPUR:
You strain too far.
I rather of his absence make this use:
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
If we without his help can make a head
To push against a kingdom, with his help
We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
As heart can think: there is not such a word
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.

HOTSPUR:
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.

VERNON:
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.

HOTSPUR:
No harm: what more?

VERNON:
And further, I have learn'd,
The king himself in person is set forth,
Or hitherwards intended speedily,
With strong and mighty preparation.

HOTSPUR:
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
And bid it pass?

VERNON:
All furnish'd, all in arms;
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
Glittering in golden coats, like images;
As full of spirit as the month of May,
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

HOTSPUR:
No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
They come like sacrifices in their trim,
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
O that Glendower were come!

VERNON:
There is more news:
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.

WORCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.

HOTSPUR:
What may the king's whole battle reach unto?

VERNON:
To thirty thousand.

HOTSPUR:
Forty let it be:
My father and Glendower being both away,
The powers of us may serve so great a day
Come, let us take a muster speedily:
Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.

BARDOLPH:
Will you give me money, captain?

FALSTAFF:
Lay out, lay out.

BARDOLPH:
This bottle makes an angel.

FALSTAFF:
An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.

BARDOLPH:
I will, captain: farewell.

FALSTAFF:
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
their services; and now my whole charge consists of
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

PRINCE HENRY:
How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!

FALSTAFF:
What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
at Shrewsbury.

WESTMORELAND:
Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
away all night.

FALSTAFF:
Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
steal cream.

PRINCE HENRY:
I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
fellows are these that come after?

FALSTAFF:
Mine, Hal, mine.

PRINCE HENRY:
I did never see such pitiful rascals.

FALSTAFF:
Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.

WESTMORELAND:
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
and bare, too beggarly.

FALSTAFF:
'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
learned that of me.

PRINCE HENRY:
No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
already in the field.

FALSTAFF:
What, is the king encamped?

WESTMORELAND:
He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.

FALSTAFF:
Well,
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

HOTSPUR:
We'll fight with him to-night.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
It may not be.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You give him then the advantage.

VERNON:
Not a whit.

HOTSPUR:
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?

VERNON:
So do we.

HOTSPUR:
His is certain, ours is doubtful.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.

VERNON:
Do not, my lord.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You do not counsel well:
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

VERNON:
Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
And I dare well maintain it with my life,
If well-respected honour bid me on,
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
Which of us fears.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Yea, or to-night.

VERNON:
Content.

HOTSPUR:
To-night, say I.

VERNON:
Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
Being men of such great leading as you are,
That you foresee not what impediments
Drag back our expedition: certain horse
Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
That not a horse is half the half of himself.

HOTSPUR:
So are the horses of the enemy
In general, journey-bated and brought low:
The better part of ours are full of rest.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The number of the king exceedeth ours:
For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I come with gracious offers from the king,
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.

HOTSPUR:
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
You were of our determination!
Some of us love you well; and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name,
Because you are not of our quality,
But stand against us like an enemy.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
And God defend but still I should stand so,
So long as out of limit and true rule
You stand against anointed majesty.
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
Audacious cruelty. If that the king
Have any way your good deserts forgot,
Which he confesseth to be manifold,
He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
You shall have your desires with interest
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
Herein misled by your suggestion.

HOTSPUR:
The king is kind; and well we know the king
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears;
And when he was not six and twenty strong,
Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
My father gave him welcome to the shore;
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
To sue his livery and beg his peace,
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
The more and less came in with cap and knee;
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
He presently, as greatness knows itself,
Steps me a little higher than his vow
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
This seeming brow of justice, did he win
The hearts of all that he did angle for;
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
Of all the favourites that the absent king
In deputation left behind him here,
When he was personal in the Irish war.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Tut, I came not to hear this.

HOTSPUR:
Then to the point.
In short time after, he deposed the king;
Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
Who is, if every owner were well placed,
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
There without ransom to lie forfeited;
Disgraced me in my happy victories,
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
This head of safety; and withal to pry
Into his title, the which we find
Too indirect for long continuance.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Shall I return this answer to the king?

HOTSPUR:
Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
Some surety for a safe return again,
And in the morning early shall my uncle
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I would you would accept of grace and love.

HOTSPUR:
And may be so we shall.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Pray God you do.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
With winged haste to the lord marshal;
This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
To whom they are directed. If you knew
How much they do to import, you would make haste.

SIR MICHAEL:
My good lord,
I guess their tenor.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Like enough you do.
To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
As I am truly given to understand,
The king with mighty and quick-raised power
Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
What with the sickness of Northumberland,
Whose power was in the first proportion,
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
Who with them was a rated sinew too
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the king.

SIR MICHAEL:
Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
No, Mortimer is not there.

SIR MICHAEL:
But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
The special head of all the land together:
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
And moe corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms.

SIR MICHAEL:
Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
For he hath heard of our confederacy,
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
Therefore make haste. I must go write again
To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

KING HENRY IV:
How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
At his distemperature.

PRINCE HENRY:
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.

KING HENRY IV:
Then with the losers let it sympathize,
For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
What say you to it? will you again unknit
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light,
And be no more an exhaled meteor,
A prodigy of fear and a portent
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear me, my liege:
For mine own part, I could be well content
To entertain the lag-end of my life
With quiet hours; for I do protest,
I have not sought the day of this dislike.

KING HENRY IV:
You have not sought it! how comes it, then?

FALSTAFF:
Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, chewet, peace!

EARL OF WORCESTER:
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our house;
And yet I must remember you, my lord,
We were the first and dearest of your friends.
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richard's time; and posted day and night
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
It was myself, my brother and his son,
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
To this we swore our aid. But in short space
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
What with our help, what with the absent king,
What with the injuries of a wanton time,
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
And the contrarious winds that held the king
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead:
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
To gripe the general sway into your hand;
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
Out of sight and raise this present head;
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.

KING HENRY IV:
These things indeed you have articulate,
Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
To face the garment of rebellion
With some fine colour that may please the eye
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Of hurlyburly innovation:
And never yet did insurrection want
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.

PRINCE HENRY:
In both your armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
This present enterprise set off his head,
I do not think a braver gentleman,
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
More daring or more bold, is now alive
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
I have a truant been to chivalry;
And so I hear he doth account me too;
Yet this before my father's majesty--
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation,
And will, to save the blood on either side,
Try fortune with him in a single fight.

KING HENRY IV:
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
Albeit considerations infinite
Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
We love our people well; even those we love
That are misled upon your cousin's part;
And, will they take the offer of our grace,
Both he and they and you, every man
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
So tell your cousin, and bring me word
What he will do: but if he will not yield,
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
We will not now be troubled with reply:
We offer fair; take it advisedly.

PRINCE HENRY:
It will not be accepted, on my life:
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms.

KING HENRY IV:
Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
For, on their answer, will we set on them:
And God befriend us, as our cause is just!

FALSTAFF:
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.

PRINCE HENRY:
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
Say thy prayers, and farewell.

FALSTAFF:
I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, thou owest God a death.

FALSTAFF:
'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
his day. What need I be so forward with him that
calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
ends my catechism.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
The liberal and kind offer of the king.

VERNON:
'Twere best he did.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then are we all undone.
It is not possible, it cannot be,
The king should keep his word in loving us;
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults:
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
For treason is but trusted like the fox,
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
Interpretation will misquote our looks,
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
And an adopted name of privilege,
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
All his offences live upon my head
And on his father's; we did train him on,
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
In any case, the offer of the king.

VERNON:
Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
Here comes your cousin.

HOTSPUR:
My uncle is return'd:
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
Uncle, what news?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The king will bid you battle presently.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.

HOTSPUR:
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
There is no seeming mercy in the king.

HOTSPUR:
Did you beg any? God forbid!

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I told him gently of our grievances,
Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.

HOTSPUR:
O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
And that no man might draw short breath today
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?

VERNON:
No, by my soul; I never in my life
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
Unless a brother should a brother dare
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
He gave you all the duties of a man;
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
Making you ever better than his praise
By still dispraising praise valued in you;
And, which became him like a prince indeed,
He made a blushing cital of himself;
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
As if he master'd there a double spirit.
Of teaching and of learning instantly.
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
If he outlive the envy of this day,
England did never owe so sweet a hope,
So much misconstrued in his wantonness.

HOTSPUR:
Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
On his follies: never did I hear
Of any prince so wild a libertine.
But be he as he will, yet once ere night
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
Better consider what you have to do
Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

Messenger:
My lord, here are letters for you.

HOTSPUR:
I cannot read them now.
O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
To spend that shortness basely were too long,
If life did ride upon a dial's point,
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
When the intent of bearing them is just.

Messenger:
My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.

HOTSPUR:
I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
For I profess not talking; only this--
Let each man do his best: and here draw I
A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day.
Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
And by that music let us all embrace;
For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
A second time do such a courtesy.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
What is thy name, that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
Upon my head?

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Know then, my name is Douglas;
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
They tell thee true.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Stafford's death.

HOTSPUR:
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
never had triumph'd upon a Scot.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.

HOTSPUR:
Where?

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Here.

HOTSPUR:
This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

HOTSPUR:
The king hath many marching in his coats.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
Until I meet the king.

HOTSPUR:
Up, and away!
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

FALSTAFF:
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
But who comes here?

PRINCE HENRY:
What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
lend me thy sword.

FALSTAFF:
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.

PRINCE HENRY:
He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
lend me thy sword.

FALSTAFF:
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.

PRINCE HENRY:
Give it to me: what, is it in the case?

FALSTAFF:
Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.

PRINCE HENRY:
What, is it a time to jest and dally now?

FALSTAFF:
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
unlooked for, and there's an end.

KING HENRY IV:
I prithee,
Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.

LANCASTER:
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.

PRINCE HENRY:
I beseech your majesty, make up,
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.

KING HENRY IV:
I will do so.
My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.

WESTMORELAND:
Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.

PRINCE HENRY:
Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!

LANCASTER:
We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.

PRINCE HENRY:
By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
But now, I do respect thee as my soul.

KING HENRY IV:
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior.

PRINCE HENRY:
O, this boy
Lends mettle to us all!

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
That counterfeit'st the person of a king?

KING HENRY IV:
The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very king. I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
I fear thou art another counterfeit;
And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
And thus I win thee.

PRINCE HENRY:
Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
Never to hold it up again! the spirits
Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.

KING HENRY IV:
Stay, and breathe awhile:
Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.

PRINCE HENRY:
O God! they did me too much injury
That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
If it were so, I might have let alone
The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.

KING HENRY IV:
Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

HOTSPUR:
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

PRINCE HENRY:
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

HOTSPUR:
My name is Harry Percy.

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
To share with me in glory any more:
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
Nor can one England brook a double reign,
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

HOTSPUR:
Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
To end the one of us; and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!

PRINCE HENRY:
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.

HOTSPUR:
I can no longer brook thy vanities.

FALSTAFF:
Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
boy's play here, I can tell you.

HOTSPUR:
O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
And time, that takes survey of all the world,
Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
And food for--

PRINCE HENRY:
For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
I could have better spared a better man:
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
If I were much in love with vanity!
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.

FALSTAFF:

PRINCE HENRY:
Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
Thy maiden sword.

LANCASTER:
But, soft! whom have we here?
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?

PRINCE HENRY:
I did; I saw him dead,
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
thou alive?
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.

FALSTAFF:
No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
earl or duke, I can assure you.

PRINCE HENRY:
Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.

FALSTAFF:
Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.

LANCASTER:
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.

PRINCE HENRY:
This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
To see what friends are living, who are dead.

FALSTAFF:
I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

KING HENRY IV:
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
A noble earl and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour,
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
What I have done my safety urged me to;
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.

KING HENRY IV:
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
Other offenders we will pause upon.
How goes the field?

PRINCE HENRY:
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
The noble Percy slain, and all his men
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
I may dispose of him.

KING HENRY IV:
With all my heart.

PRINCE HENRY:
Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
This honourable bounty shall belong:
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
His valour shown upon our crests to-day
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

LANCASTER:
I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
Which I shall give away immediately.

KING HENRY IV:
Then this remains, that we divide our power.
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
Meeting the cheque of such another day:
And since this business so fair is done,
Let us not leave till all our own be won.

BERNARDO:
Who's there?

FRANCISCO:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO:
Long live the king!

FRANCISCO:
Bernardo?

BERNARDO:
He.

FRANCISCO:
You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO:
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO:
Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO:
Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO:
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO:
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

HORATIO:
Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS:
And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO:
Give you good night.

MARCELLUS:
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO:
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.

MARCELLUS:
Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO:
Say,
What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO:
A piece of him.

BERNARDO:
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS:
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO:
I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS:
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO:
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO:
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.

HORATIO:
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BERNARDO:
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--

MARCELLUS:
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BERNARDO:
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARCELLUS:
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BERNARDO:
Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.

HORATIO:
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

BERNARDO:
It would be spoke to.

MARCELLUS:
Question it, Horatio.

HORATIO:
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

MARCELLUS:
It is offended.

BERNARDO:
See, it stalks away!

HORATIO:
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

MARCELLUS:
'Tis gone, and will not answer.

BERNARDO:
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?

HORATIO:
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

MARCELLUS:
Is it not like the king?

HORATIO:
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.

MARCELLUS:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

HORATIO:
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

MARCELLUS:
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?

HORATIO:
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

BERNARDO:
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.

HORATIO:
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

MARCELLUS:
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

HORATIO:
Do, if it will not stand.

BERNARDO:
'Tis here!

HORATIO:
'Tis here!

MARCELLUS:
'Tis gone!
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

BERNARDO:
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

HORATIO:
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.

MARCELLUS:
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

HORATIO:
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

MARCELLUS:
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

CORNELIUS:
In that and all things will we show our duty.

KING CLAUDIUS:
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

LAERTES:
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

LORD POLONIUS:
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

HAMLET:

KING CLAUDIUS:
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

HAMLET:
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

HAMLET:
Ay, madam, it is common.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?

HAMLET:
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

KING CLAUDIUS:
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

HAMLET:
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

HAMLET:
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

HORATIO:
Hail to your lordship!

HAMLET:
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.

HORATIO:
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

HAMLET:
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

MARCELLUS:
My good lord--

HAMLET:
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

HORATIO:
A truant disposition, good my lord.

HAMLET:
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

HORATIO:
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

HAMLET:
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

HORATIO:
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

HAMLET:
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.

HORATIO:
Where, my lord?

HAMLET:
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

HORATIO:
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

HAMLET:
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.

HORATIO:
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

HAMLET:
Saw? who?

HORATIO:
My lord, the king your father.

HAMLET:
The king my father!

HORATIO:
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.

HAMLET:
For God's love, let me hear.

HORATIO:
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.

HAMLET:
But where was this?

MARCELLUS:
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

HAMLET:
Did you not speak to it?

HORATIO:
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.

HAMLET:
'Tis very strange.

HORATIO:
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.

HAMLET:
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?

MARCELLUS:
We do, my lord.

HAMLET:
Arm'd, say you?

MARCELLUS:
Arm'd, my lord.

HAMLET:
From top to toe?

MARCELLUS:
My lord, from head to foot.

HAMLET:
Then saw you not his face?

HORATIO:
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

HAMLET:
What, look'd he frowningly?

HORATIO:
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

HAMLET:
Pale or red?

HORATIO:
Nay, very pale.

HAMLET:
And fix'd his eyes upon you?

HORATIO:
Most constantly.

HAMLET:
I would I had been there.

HORATIO:
It would have much amazed you.

HAMLET:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

HORATIO:
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

MARCELLUS:
Longer, longer.

HORATIO:
Not when I saw't.

HAMLET:
His beard was grizzled--no?

HORATIO:
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.

HAMLET:
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.

HORATIO:
I warrant it will.

HAMLET:
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.

All:
Our duty to your honour.

HAMLET:
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

LAERTES:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.

OPHELIA:
Do you doubt that?

LAERTES:
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

OPHELIA:
No more but so?

LAERTES:
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

OPHELIA:
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.

LAERTES:
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

LORD POLONIUS:
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

LAERTES:
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.

LAERTES:
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.

OPHELIA:
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

LAERTES:
Farewell.

LORD POLONIUS:
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?

OPHELIA:
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

LORD POLONIUS:
Marry, well bethought:
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.

OPHELIA:
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.

LORD POLONIUS:
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

OPHELIA:
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

LORD POLONIUS:
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

OPHELIA:
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.

LORD POLONIUS:
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

OPHELIA:
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

LORD POLONIUS:
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

OPHELIA:
I shall obey, my lord.

HAMLET:
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

HORATIO:
It is a nipping and an eager air.

HAMLET:
What hour now?

HORATIO:
I think it lacks of twelve.

HAMLET:
No, it is struck.

HORATIO:
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What does this mean, my lord?

HAMLET:
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.

HORATIO:
Is it a custom?

HAMLET:
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.

HORATIO:
Look, my lord, it comes!

HAMLET:
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?

HORATIO:
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.

MARCELLUS:
Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.

HORATIO:
No, by no means.

HAMLET:
It will not speak; then I will follow it.

HORATIO:
Do not, my lord.

HAMLET:
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

HORATIO:
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.

HAMLET:
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.

MARCELLUS:
You shall not go, my lord.

HAMLET:
Hold off your hands.

HORATIO:
Be ruled; you shall not go.

HAMLET:
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

HORATIO:
He waxes desperate with imagination.

MARCELLUS:
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

HORATIO:
Have after. To what issue will this come?

MARCELLUS:
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

HORATIO:
Heaven will direct it.

MARCELLUS:
Nay, let's follow him.

HAMLET:
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

Ghost:
Mark me.

HAMLET:
I will.

Ghost:
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.

HAMLET:
Alas, poor ghost!

Ghost:
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.

HAMLET:
Speak; I am bound to hear.

Ghost:
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

HAMLET:
What?

Ghost:
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

HAMLET:
O God!

Ghost:
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

HAMLET:
Murder!

Ghost:
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

HAMLET:
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.

Ghost:
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.

HAMLET:
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

Ghost:
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

HAMLET:
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
I have sworn 't.

MARCELLUS:

MARCELLUS:

HORATIO:

HAMLET:
So be it!

HORATIO:

HAMLET:
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

MARCELLUS:
How is't, my noble lord?

HORATIO:
What news, my lord?

HAMLET:
O, wonderful!

HORATIO:
Good my lord, tell it.

HAMLET:
No; you'll reveal it.

HORATIO:
Not I, my lord, by heaven.

MARCELLUS:
Nor I, my lord.

HAMLET:
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?

HORATIO:
Ay, by heaven, my lord.

HAMLET:
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.

HORATIO:
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.

HAMLET:
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.

HORATIO:
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

HAMLET:
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 'faith heartily.

HORATIO:
There's no offence, my lord.

HAMLET:
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.

HORATIO:
What is't, my lord? we will.

HAMLET:
Never make known what you have seen to-night.

HORATIO:
My lord, we will not.

HAMLET:
Nay, but swear't.

HORATIO:
In faith,
My lord, not I.

MARCELLUS:
Nor I, my lord, in faith.

HAMLET:
Upon my sword.

MARCELLUS:
We have sworn, my lord, already.

HAMLET:
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

Ghost:

HAMLET:
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
truepenny?
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.

HORATIO:
Propose the oath, my lord.

HAMLET:
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword.

Ghost:

HAMLET:
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.

Ghost:

HAMLET:
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

HORATIO:
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

HAMLET:
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.

Ghost:

HAMLET:
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.

LORD POLONIUS:
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

REYNALDO:
I will, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.

REYNALDO:
My lord, I did intend it.

LORD POLONIUS:
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?

REYNALDO:
Ay, very well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.

REYNALDO:
As gaming, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.

REYNALDO:
My lord, that would dishonour him.

LORD POLONIUS:
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.

REYNALDO:
But, my good lord,--

LORD POLONIUS:
Wherefore should you do this?

REYNALDO:
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.

LORD POLONIUS:
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.

REYNALDO:
Very good, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?

REYNALDO:
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
and 'gentleman.'

LORD POLONIUS:
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

REYNALDO:
My lord, I have.

LORD POLONIUS:
God be wi' you; fare you well.

REYNALDO:
Good my lord!

LORD POLONIUS:
Observe his inclination in yourself.

REYNALDO:
I shall, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
And let him ply his music.

REYNALDO:
Well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS:
Farewell!
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

OPHELIA:
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

LORD POLONIUS:
With what, i' the name of God?

OPHELIA:
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

LORD POLONIUS:
Mad for thy love?

OPHELIA:
My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.

LORD POLONIUS:
What said he?

OPHELIA:
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

LORD POLONIUS:
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?

OPHELIA:
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me.

LORD POLONIUS:
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.

GUILDENSTERN:
But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

GUILDENSTERN:
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Ay, amen!

LORD POLONIUS:
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully return'd.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Thou still hast been the father of good news.

LORD POLONIUS:
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

KING CLAUDIUS:
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

LORD POLONIUS:
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?

VOLTIMAND:
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.

KING CLAUDIUS:
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!

LORD POLONIUS:
This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
More matter, with less art.

LORD POLONIUS:
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia,'--
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Came this from Hamlet to her?

LORD POLONIUS:
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.

KING CLAUDIUS:
But how hath she
Received his love?

LORD POLONIUS:
What do you think of me?

KING CLAUDIUS:
As of a man faithful and honourable.

LORD POLONIUS:
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Do you think 'tis this?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
It may be, very likely.

LORD POLONIUS:
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Not that I know.

LORD POLONIUS:

KING CLAUDIUS:
How may we try it further?

LORD POLONIUS:
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
So he does indeed.

LORD POLONIUS:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.

KING CLAUDIUS:
We will try it.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

LORD POLONIUS:
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.
O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

HAMLET:
Well, God-a-mercy.

LORD POLONIUS:
Do you know me, my lord?

HAMLET:
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.

LORD POLONIUS:
Not I, my lord.

HAMLET:
Then I would you were so honest a man.

LORD POLONIUS:
Honest, my lord!

HAMLET:
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.

LORD POLONIUS:
That's very true, my lord.

HAMLET:
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?

LORD POLONIUS:
I have, my lord.

HAMLET:
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to 't.

LORD POLONIUS:

HAMLET:
Words, words, words.

LORD POLONIUS:
What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET:
Between who?

LORD POLONIUS:
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

HAMLET:
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.

LORD POLONIUS:

HAMLET:
Into my grave.

LORD POLONIUS:
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.

HAMLET:
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.

LORD POLONIUS:
Fare you well, my lord.

HAMLET:
These tedious old fools!

LORD POLONIUS:
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

ROSENCRANTZ:

GUILDENSTERN:
My honoured lord!

ROSENCRANTZ:
My most dear lord!

HAMLET:
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

ROSENCRANTZ:
As the indifferent children of the earth.

GUILDENSTERN:
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

HAMLET:
Nor the soles of her shoe?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Neither, my lord.

HAMLET:
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
her favours?

GUILDENSTERN:
'Faith, her privates we.

HAMLET:
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
is a strumpet. What's the news?

ROSENCRANTZ:
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

HAMLET:
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?

GUILDENSTERN:
Prison, my lord!

HAMLET:
Denmark's a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Then is the world one.

HAMLET:
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.

ROSENCRANTZ:
We think not so, my lord.

HAMLET:
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
narrow for your mind.

HAMLET:
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.

GUILDENSTERN:
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

HAMLET:
A dream itself is but a shadow.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.

HAMLET:
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.

ROSENCRANTZ:
We'll wait upon you.

HAMLET:
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?

ROSENCRANTZ:
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

HAMLET:
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.

GUILDENSTERN:
What should we say, my lord?

HAMLET:
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.

ROSENCRANTZ:
To what end, my lord?

HAMLET:
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?

ROSENCRANTZ:

HAMLET:

GUILDENSTERN:
My lord, we were sent for.

HAMLET:
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.

ROSENCRANTZ:
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

HAMLET:
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?

ROSENCRANTZ:
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
coming, to offer you service.

HAMLET:
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
for't. What players are they?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
tragedians of the city.

HAMLET:
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.

ROSENCRANTZ:
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation.

HAMLET:
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so followed?

ROSENCRANTZ:
No, indeed, are they not.

HAMLET:
How comes it? do they grow rusty?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

HAMLET:
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players--as it is most like, if their means are no
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own succession?

ROSENCRANTZ:
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.

HAMLET:
Is't possible?

GUILDENSTERN:
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

HAMLET:
Do the boys carry it away?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.

HAMLET:
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.

GUILDENSTERN:
There are the players.

HAMLET:
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

GUILDENSTERN:
In what, my dear lord?

HAMLET:
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.

LORD POLONIUS:
Well be with you, gentlemen!

HAMLET:
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
say an old man is twice a child.

HAMLET:
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
'twas so indeed.

LORD POLONIUS:
My lord, I have news to tell you.

HAMLET:
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--

LORD POLONIUS:
The actors are come hither, my lord.

HAMLET:
Buz, buz!

LORD POLONIUS:
Upon mine honour,--

HAMLET:
Then came each actor on his ass,--

LORD POLONIUS:
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.

HAMLET:
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

LORD POLONIUS:
What a treasure had he, my lord?

HAMLET:
Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'

LORD POLONIUS:

HAMLET:
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

LORD POLONIUS:
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.

HAMLET:
Nay, that follows not.

LORD POLONIUS:
What follows, then, my lord?

HAMLET:
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.

First Player:
What speech, my lord?

HAMLET:
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So, proceed you.

LORD POLONIUS:
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.

First Player:
'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod 'take away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!'

LORD POLONIUS:
This is too long.

HAMLET:
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.

First Player:
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'

HAMLET:
'The mobled queen?'

LORD POLONIUS:
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.

First Player:
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'

LORD POLONIUS:
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.

HAMLET:
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live.

LORD POLONIUS:
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

HAMLET:
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.

LORD POLONIUS:
Come, sirs.

HAMLET:
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?

First Player:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?

First Player:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
not.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Good my lord!

HAMLET:
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

KING CLAUDIUS:
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

ROSENCRANTZ:
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause he will by no means speak.

GUILDENSTERN:
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Did he receive you well?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Most like a gentleman.

GUILDENSTERN:
But with much forcing of his disposition.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Did you assay him?
To any pastime?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.

LORD POLONIUS:
'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.

KING CLAUDIUS:
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

ROSENCRANTZ:
We shall, my lord.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia:
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

OPHELIA:
Madam, I wish it may.

LORD POLONIUS:
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.
Read on this book;
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.

KING CLAUDIUS:

LORD POLONIUS:
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

HAMLET:
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

OPHELIA:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?

HAMLET:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.

HAMLET:
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

HAMLET:
Ha, ha! are you honest?

OPHELIA:
My lord?

HAMLET:
Are you fair?

OPHELIA:
What means your lordship?

HAMLET:
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA:
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
with honesty?

HAMLET:
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.

OPHELIA:
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

HAMLET:
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.

OPHELIA:
I was the more deceived.

HAMLET:
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?

OPHELIA:
At home, my lord.

HAMLET:
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.

OPHELIA:
O, help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET:
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.

OPHELIA:
O heavenly powers, restore him!

HAMLET:
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.

OPHELIA:
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

LORD POLONIUS:
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

KING CLAUDIUS:
It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

HAMLET:
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

First Player:
I warrant your honour.

HAMLET:
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

First Player:
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.

HAMLET:
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?

LORD POLONIUS:
And the queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET:
Bid the players make haste.
Will you two help to hasten them?

ROSENCRANTZ:
We will, my lord.

HAMLET:
What ho! Horatio!

HORATIO:
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

HAMLET:
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

HORATIO:
O, my dear lord,--

HAMLET:
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.

HORATIO:
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

HAMLET:
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.

KING CLAUDIUS:
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET:
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.

HAMLET:
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

LORD POLONIUS:
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET:
What did you enact?

LORD POLONIUS:
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus killed me.

HAMLET:
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET:
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

LORD POLONIUS:

HAMLET:
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

OPHELIA:
No, my lord.

HAMLET:
I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA:
I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET:
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

OPHELIA:
What is, my lord?

HAMLET:
Nothing.

OPHELIA:
You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET:
Who, I?

OPHELIA:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

OPHELIA:
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'

OPHELIA:
What means this, my lord?

HAMLET:
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA:
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

HAMLET:
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.

OPHELIA:
Will he tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET:
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

OPHELIA:
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

Prologue:
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.

HAMLET:
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

OPHELIA:
'Tis brief, my lord.

HAMLET:
As woman's love.

Player King:
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

Player Queen:
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

Player King:
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--

Player Queen:
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

HAMLET:

Player Queen:
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.

Player King:
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Player Queen:
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

HAMLET:
If she should break it now!

Player King:
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.

Player Queen:
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!

HAMLET:
Madam, how like you this play?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
The lady protests too much, methinks.

HAMLET:
O, but she'll keep her word.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?

HAMLET:
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.

KING CLAUDIUS:
What do you call the play?

HAMLET:
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

OPHELIA:
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

HAMLET:
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
could see the puppets dallying.

OPHELIA:
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

HAMLET:
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

OPHELIA:
Still better, and worse.

HAMLET:
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'

LUCIANUS:
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.

HAMLET:
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

OPHELIA:
The king rises.

HAMLET:
What, frighted with false fire!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
How fares my lord?

LORD POLONIUS:
Give o'er the play.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Give me some light: away!

All:
Lights, lights, lights!

HAMLET:
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

HORATIO:
Half a share.

HAMLET:
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very--pajock.

HORATIO:
You might have rhymed.

HAMLET:
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?

HORATIO:
Very well, my lord.

HAMLET:
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

HORATIO:
I did very well note him.

HAMLET:
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!

GUILDENSTERN:
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

HAMLET:
Sir, a whole history.

GUILDENSTERN:
The king, sir,--

HAMLET:
Ay, sir, what of him?

GUILDENSTERN:
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

HAMLET:
With drink, sir?

GUILDENSTERN:
No, my lord, rather with choler.

HAMLET:
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.

GUILDENSTERN:
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.

HAMLET:
I am tame, sir: pronounce.

GUILDENSTERN:
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.

HAMLET:
You are welcome.

GUILDENSTERN:
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.

HAMLET:
Sir, I cannot.

GUILDENSTERN:
What, my lord?

HAMLET:
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--

ROSENCRANTZ:
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.

HAMLET:
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.

ROSENCRANTZ:
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go to bed.

HAMLET:
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?

ROSENCRANTZ:
My lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET:
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.

HAMLET:
Sir, I lack advancement.

ROSENCRANTZ:
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?

HAMLET:
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?

GUILDENSTERN:
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.

HAMLET:
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN:
My lord, I cannot.

HAMLET:
I pray you.

GUILDENSTERN:
Believe me, I cannot.

HAMLET:
I do beseech you.

GUILDENSTERN:
I know no touch of it, my lord.

HAMLET:
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.

GUILDENSTERN:
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.

HAMLET:
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
God bless you, sir!

LORD POLONIUS:
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.

HAMLET:
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

LORD POLONIUS:
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

HAMLET:
Methinks it is like a weasel.

LORD POLONIUS:
It is backed like a weasel.

HAMLET:
Or like a whale?

LORD POLONIUS:
Very like a whale.

HAMLET:
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.

LORD POLONIUS:
I will say so.

HAMLET:
By and by is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

KING CLAUDIUS:
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.

GUILDENSTERN:
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.

ROSENCRANTZ:
The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.

ROSENCRANTZ:
We will haste us.

LORD POLONIUS:
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Thanks, dear my lord.
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.

HAMLET:
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

KING CLAUDIUS:

LORD POLONIUS:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

HAMLET:

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

HAMLET:
Now, mother, what's the matter?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET:
Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET:
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Why, how now, Hamlet!

HAMLET:
What's the matter now?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Have you forgot me?

HAMLET:
No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET:
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!

LORD POLONIUS:

HAMLET:

LORD POLONIUS:

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET:
Nay, I know not:
Is it the king?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET:
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
As kill a king!

HAMLET:
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

HAMLET:
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

HAMLET:
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

HAMLET:
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!

HAMLET:
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
No more!

HAMLET:
A king of shreds and patches,--
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alas, he's mad!

HAMLET:
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!

Ghost:
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.

HAMLET:
How is it with you, lady?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

HAMLET:
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
To whom do you speak this?

HAMLET:
Do you see nothing there?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

HAMLET:
Nor did you nothing hear?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
No, nothing but ourselves.

HAMLET:
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.

HAMLET:
Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

HAMLET:
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either ... the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
What shall I do?

HAMLET:
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.

HAMLET:
I must to England; you know that?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

HAMLET:
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.

KING CLAUDIUS:
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!

KING CLAUDIUS:
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.

KING CLAUDIUS:
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

KING CLAUDIUS:
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done...
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

HAMLET:
Safely stowed.

ROSENCRANTZ:

HAMLET:
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.

ROSENCRANTZ:
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

HAMLET:
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.

HAMLET:
Do not believe it.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Believe what?

HAMLET:
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

HAMLET:
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.

ROSENCRANTZ:
I understand you not, my lord.

HAMLET:
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.

ROSENCRANTZ:
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.

HAMLET:
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--

GUILDENSTERN:
A thing, my lord!

HAMLET:
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
How now! what hath befall'n?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.

KING CLAUDIUS:
But where is he?

ROSENCRANTZ:
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Bring him before us.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

HAMLET:
At supper.

KING CLAUDIUS:
At supper! where?

HAMLET:
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Alas, alas!

HAMLET:
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

KING CLAUDIUS:
What dost you mean by this?

HAMLET:
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Where is Polonius?

HAMLET:
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Go seek him there.

HAMLET:
He will stay till ye come.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.

HAMLET:
For England!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Ay, Hamlet.

HAMLET:
Good.

KING CLAUDIUS:
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

HAMLET:
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
England! Farewell, dear mother.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

HAMLET:
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.

Captain:
I will do't, my lord.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Go softly on.

HAMLET:
Good sir, whose powers are these?

Captain:
They are of Norway, sir.

HAMLET:
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

Captain:
Against some part of Poland.

HAMLET:
Who commands them, sir?

Captain:
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

HAMLET:
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?

Captain:
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

HAMLET:
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

Captain:
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

HAMLET:
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

Captain:
God be wi' you, sir.

ROSENCRANTZ:
Wilt please you go, my lord?

HAMLET:
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I will not speak with her.

Gentleman:
She is importunate, indeed distract:
Her mood will needs be pitied.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
What would she have?

Gentleman:
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

HORATIO:
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Let her come in.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

OPHELIA:
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
How now, Ophelia!

OPHELIA:

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

OPHELIA:
Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Nay, but, Ophelia,--

OPHELIA:
Pray you, mark.
White his shroud as the mountain snow,--

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alas, look here, my lord.

OPHELIA:

KING CLAUDIUS:
How do you, pretty lady?

OPHELIA:
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
what we may be. God be at your table!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Conceit upon her father.

OPHELIA:
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
ask you what it means, say you this:
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
All in the morning betime,
And I a maid at your window,
To be your Valentine.
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Never departed more.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Pretty Ophelia!

OPHELIA:
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
By cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
You promised me to wed.
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.

KING CLAUDIUS:
How long hath she been thus?

OPHELIA:
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
good night, good night.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Follow her close; give her good watch,
I pray you.
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Alack, what noise is this?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
What is the matter?

Gentleman:
Save yourself, my lord:
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

KING CLAUDIUS:
The doors are broke.

LAERTES:
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.

Danes:
No, let's come in.

LAERTES:
I pray you, give me leave.

Danes:
We will, we will.

LAERTES:
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
Give me my father!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Calmly, good Laertes.

LAERTES:
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.

KING CLAUDIUS:
What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.

LAERTES:
Where is my father?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Dead.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
But not by him.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Let him demand his fill.

LAERTES:
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Who shall stay you?

LAERTES:
My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
They shall go far with little.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?

LAERTES:
None but his enemies.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Will you know them then?

LAERTES:
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye.

Danes:

LAERTES:
How now! what noise is that?
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.

OPHELIA:

LAERTES:
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
It could not move thus.

OPHELIA:

LAERTES:
This nothing's more than matter.

OPHELIA:
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.

LAERTES:
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

OPHELIA:
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: they say he made a good end,--
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

LAERTES:
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favour and to prettiness.

OPHELIA:

LAERTES:
Do you see this, O God?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content.

LAERTES:
Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral--
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.

KING CLAUDIUS:
So you shall;
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you, go with me.

HORATIO:
What are they that would speak with me?

Servant:
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.

HORATIO:
Let them come in.
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

First Sailor:
God bless you, sir.

HORATIO:
Let him bless thee too.

First Sailor:
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
let to know it is.

HORATIO:

KING CLAUDIUS:
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.

LAERTES:
It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.

KING CLAUDIUS:
O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim'd them.

LAERTES:
And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
How now! what news?

Messenger:
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.

KING CLAUDIUS:
From Hamlet! who brought them?

Messenger:
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Of him that brought them.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

LAERTES:
Know you the hand?

KING CLAUDIUS:
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?

LAERTES:
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'

KING CLAUDIUS:
If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?

LAERTES:
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

KING CLAUDIUS:
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident.

LAERTES:
My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ.

KING CLAUDIUS:
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.

LAERTES:
What part is that, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS:
A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Come short of what he did.

LAERTES:
A Norman was't?

KING CLAUDIUS:
A Norman.

LAERTES:
Upon my life, Lamond.

KING CLAUDIUS:
The very same.

LAERTES:
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.

KING CLAUDIUS:
He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Now, out of this,--

LAERTES:
What out of this, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?

LAERTES:
Why ask you this?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?

LAERTES:
To cut his throat i' the church.

KING CLAUDIUS:
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Requite him for your father.

LAERTES:
I will do't:
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
How now, sweet queen!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

LAERTES:
Drown'd! O, where?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.

LAERTES:
Alas, then, she is drown'd?

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Drown'd, drown'd.

LAERTES:
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Therefore let's follow.

First Clown:
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?

Second Clown:
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.

First Clown:
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
own defence?

Second Clown:
Why, 'tis found so.

First Clown:
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly.

Second Clown:
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--

First Clown:
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

Second Clown:
But is this law?

First Clown:
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

Second Clown:
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Christian burial.

First Clown:
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam's profession.

Second Clown:
Was he a gentleman?

First Clown:
He was the first that ever bore arms.

Second Clown:
Why, he had none.

First Clown:
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself--

Second Clown:
Go to.

First Clown:
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

Second Clown:
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.

First Clown:
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.

Second Clown:
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
a carpenter?'

First Clown:
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

Second Clown:
Marry, now I can tell.

First Clown:
To't.

Second Clown:
Mass, I cannot tell.

First Clown:
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
you are asked this question next, say 'a
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.
In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
O, methought, there was nothing meet.

HAMLET:
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
sings at grave-making?

HORATIO:
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

HAMLET:
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.

First Clown:

HAMLET:
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
might it not?

HORATIO:
It might, my lord.

HAMLET:
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?

HORATIO:
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET:
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.

First Clown:
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet:
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.

HAMLET:
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?

HORATIO:
Not a jot more, my lord.

HAMLET:
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?

HORATIO:
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.

HAMLET:
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's this, sirrah?

First Clown:
Mine, sir.
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.

HAMLET:
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.

First Clown:
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

HAMLET:
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

First Clown:
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
you.

HAMLET:
What man dost thou dig it for?

First Clown:
For no man, sir.

HAMLET:
What woman, then?

First Clown:
For none, neither.

HAMLET:
Who is to be buried in't?

First Clown:
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

HAMLET:
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?

First Clown:
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

HAMLET:
How long is that since?

First Clown:
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
is mad, and sent into England.

HAMLET:
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

First Clown:
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

HAMLET:
Why?

First Clown:
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
are as mad as he.

HAMLET:
How came he mad?

First Clown:
Very strangely, they say.

HAMLET:
How strangely?

First Clown:
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

HAMLET:
Upon what ground?

First Clown:
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
and boy, thirty years.

HAMLET:
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

First Clown:
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.

HAMLET:
Why he more than another?

First Clown:
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.

HAMLET:
Whose was it?

First Clown:
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?

HAMLET:
Nay, I know not.

First Clown:
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

HAMLET:
This?

First Clown:
E'en that.

HAMLET:
Let me see.
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.

HORATIO:
What's that, my lord?

HAMLET:
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?

HORATIO:
E'en so.

HAMLET:
And smelt so? pah!

HORATIO:
E'en so, my lord.

HAMLET:
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

HORATIO:
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

HAMLET:
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.

LAERTES:
What ceremony else?

HAMLET:
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth: mark.

LAERTES:
What ceremony else?

First Priest:
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.

LAERTES:
Must there no more be done?

First Priest:
No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.

LAERTES:
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.

HAMLET:
What, the fair Ophelia!

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.

LAERTES:
O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.

HAMLET:

LAERTES:
The devil take thy soul!

HAMLET:
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Pluck them asunder.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Hamlet, Hamlet!

All:
Gentlemen,--

HORATIO:
Good my lord, be quiet.

HAMLET:
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
O my son, what theme?

HAMLET:
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

KING CLAUDIUS:
O, he is mad, Laertes.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
For love of God, forbear him.

HAMLET:
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.

HAMLET:
Hear you, sir;
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument:
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

HAMLET:
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?

HORATIO:
Remember it, my lord?

HAMLET:
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will,--

HORATIO:
That is most certain.

HAMLET:
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.

HORATIO:
Is't possible?

HAMLET:
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

HORATIO:
I beseech you.

HAMLET:
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?

HORATIO:
Ay, good my lord.

HAMLET:
An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.

HORATIO:
How was this seal'd?

HAMLET:
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.

HORATIO:
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

HAMLET:
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.

HORATIO:
Why, what a king is this!

HAMLET:
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?

HORATIO:
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.

HAMLET:
It will be short: the interim is mine;
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.

HORATIO:
Peace! who comes here?

OSRIC:
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

HAMLET:
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?

HORATIO:
No, my good lord.

HAMLET:
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC:
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

HAMLET:
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

OSRIC:
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

HAMLET:
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
northerly.

OSRIC:
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET:
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.

OSRIC:
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--

HAMLET:
I beseech you, remember--

OSRIC:
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET:
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.

OSRIC:
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET:
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC:
Sir?

HORATIO:
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, sir, really.

HAMLET:
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

OSRIC:
Of Laertes?

HORATIO:
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

HAMLET:
Of him, sir.

OSRIC:
I know you are not ignorant--

HAMLET:
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC:
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

HAMLET:
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.

OSRIC:
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

HAMLET:
What's his weapon?

OSRIC:
Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET:
That's two of his weapons: but, well.

OSRIC:
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET:
What call you the carriages?

HORATIO:
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.

OSRIC:
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET:
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?

OSRIC:
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET:
How if I answer 'no'?

OSRIC:
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

HAMLET:
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

OSRIC:
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

HAMLET:
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

OSRIC:
I commend my duty to your lordship.

HAMLET:
Yours, yours.
He does well to commend it himself; there are no
tongues else for's turn.

HORATIO:
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

HAMLET:
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

Lord:
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.

HAMLET:
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

Lord:
The king and queen and all are coming down.

HAMLET:
In happy time.

Lord:
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET:
She well instructs me.

HORATIO:
You will lose this wager, my lord.

HAMLET:
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.

HORATIO:
Nay, good my lord,--

HAMLET:
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO:
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.

HAMLET:
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

KING CLAUDIUS:
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

HAMLET:
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.

LAERTES:
I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.

HAMLET:
I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.

LAERTES:
Come, one for me.

HAMLET:
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.

LAERTES:
You mock me, sir.

HAMLET:
No, by this hand.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?

HAMLET:
Very well, my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

LAERTES:
This is too heavy, let me see another.

HAMLET:
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

OSRIC:
Ay, my good lord.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

HAMLET:
Come on, sir.

LAERTES:
Come, my lord.

HAMLET:
One.

LAERTES:
No.

HAMLET:
Judgment.

OSRIC:
A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES:
Well; again.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
Give him the cup.

HAMLET:
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
Another hit; what say you?

LAERTES:
A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING CLAUDIUS:
Our son shall win.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

HAMLET:
Good madam!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

KING CLAUDIUS:

HAMLET:
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES:
My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING CLAUDIUS:
I do not think't.

LAERTES:

HAMLET:
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

LAERTES:
Say you so? come on.

OSRIC:
Nothing, neither way.

LAERTES:
Have at you now!

KING CLAUDIUS:
Part them; they are incensed.

HAMLET:
Nay, come, again.

OSRIC:
Look to the queen there, ho!

HORATIO:
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

OSRIC:
How is't, Laertes?

LAERTES:
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

HAMLET:
How does the queen?

KING CLAUDIUS:
She swounds to see them bleed.

QUEEN GERTRUDE:
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

HAMLET:
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.

LAERTES:
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

HAMLET:
The point!--envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.

All:
Treason! treason!

KING CLAUDIUS:
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

HAMLET:
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.

LAERTES:
He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.

HAMLET:
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.

HORATIO:
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.

HAMLET:
As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?

OSRIC:
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.

HAMLET:
O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

HORATIO:
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Where is this sight?

HORATIO:
What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?

First Ambassador:
The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England come too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?

HORATIO:
Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
Truly deliver.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

HORATIO:
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
On plots and errors, happen.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

SHALLOW:
Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.

SLENDER:
In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and
'Coram.'

SHALLOW:
Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.

SLENDER:
Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'

SHALLOW:
Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
hundred years.

SLENDER:
All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.

SHALLOW:
It is an old coat.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
man, and signifies love.

SHALLOW:
The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.

SLENDER:
I may quarter, coz.

SHALLOW:
You may, by marrying.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

SHALLOW:
Not a whit.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
between you.

SHALLOW:
The council shall bear it; it is a riot.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
riot; take your vizaments in that.

SHALLOW:
Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
should end it.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
and there is also another device in my prain, which
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
Page, which is pretty virginity.

SLENDER:
Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
small like a woman.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.

SLENDER:
Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.

SLENDER:
I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.

SHALLOW:
Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.
What, hoa! Got pless your house here!

PAGE:

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
matters grow to your likings.

PAGE:
I am glad to see your worships well.
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW:
Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.

PAGE:
Sir, I thank you.

SHALLOW:
Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.

PAGE:
I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.

SLENDER:
How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
was outrun on Cotsall.

PAGE:
It could not be judged, sir.

SLENDER:
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

SHALLOW:
That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
'tis a good dog.

PAGE:
A cur, sir.

SHALLOW:
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
Falstaff here?

PAGE:
Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
office between you.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

SHALLOW:
He hath wronged me, Master Page.

PAGE:
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.

SHALLOW:
If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.

PAGE:
Here comes Sir John.

FALSTAFF:
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

SHALLOW:
Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
broke open my lodge.

FALSTAFF:
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?

SHALLOW:
Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.

FALSTAFF:
I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
That is now answered.

SHALLOW:
The council shall know this.

FALSTAFF:
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
you'll be laughed at.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.

FALSTAFF:
Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
head: what matter have you against me?

SLENDER:
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.

BARDOLPH:
You Banbury cheese!

SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.

PISTOL:
How now, Mephostophilus!

SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.

NYM:
Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.

SLENDER:
Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.

PAGE:
We three, to hear it and end it between them.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
as great discreetly as we can.

FALSTAFF:
Pistol!

PISTOL:
He hears with ears.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.

FALSTAFF:
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

SLENDER:
Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.

FALSTAFF:
Is this true, Pistol?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

PISTOL:
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!

SLENDER:
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.

NYM:
Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
humour on me; that is the very note of it.

SLENDER:
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.

FALSTAFF:
What say you, Scarlet and John?

BARDOLPH:
Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
himself out of his five sentences.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!

BARDOLPH:
And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
so conclusions passed the careires.

SLENDER:
Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

FALSTAFF:
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.

PAGE:
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.

SLENDER:
O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.

PAGE:
How now, Mistress Ford!

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
by your leave, good mistress.

PAGE:
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
we shall drink down all unkindness.

SLENDER:
I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
Songs and Sonnets here.
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
about you, have you?

SIMPLE:
Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?

SHALLOW:
Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
here. Do you understand me?

SLENDER:
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall do that that is reason.

SHALLOW:
Nay, but understand me.

SLENDER:
So I do, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.

SLENDER:
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.

SHALLOW:
Ay, there's the point, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.

SLENDER:
Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?

SHALLOW:
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?

SLENDER:
I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would do reason.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.

SHALLOW:
That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?

SLENDER:
I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
request, cousin, in any reason.

SHALLOW:
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?

SLENDER:
I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
married and have more occasion to know one another;
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.

SHALLOW:
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

SLENDER:
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!

SHALLOW:
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!

ANNE PAGE:
The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.

SHALLOW:
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.

ANNE PAGE:
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

SLENDER:
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.

ANNE PAGE:
The dinner attends you, sir.

SLENDER:
I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
cousin Shallow.
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
live like a poor gentleman born.

ANNE PAGE:
I may not go in without your worship: they will not
sit till you come.

SLENDER:
I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
though I did.

ANNE PAGE:
I pray you, sir, walk in.

SLENDER:
I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?

ANNE PAGE:
I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

SLENDER:
I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
the bear loose, are you not?

ANNE PAGE:
Ay, indeed, sir.

SLENDER:
That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.

PAGE:
Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

SLENDER:
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

PAGE:
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.

SLENDER:
Nay, pray you, lead the way.

PAGE:
Come on, sir.

SLENDER:
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.

ANNE PAGE:
Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

SLENDER:
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
his wringer.

SIMPLE:
Well, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
and require her to solicit your master's desires to
Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

FALSTAFF:
Mine host of the Garter!

Host:
What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.

FALSTAFF:
Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.

Host:
Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.

FALSTAFF:
I sit at ten pounds a week.

Host:
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
tap: said I well, bully Hector?

FALSTAFF:
Do so, good mine host.

Host:
I have spoke; let him follow.
Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.

BARDOLPH:
It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.

PISTOL:
O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?

NYM:
He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?

FALSTAFF:
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an
unskilful singer; he kept not time.

NYM:
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.

PISTOL:
'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
for the phrase!

FALSTAFF:
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

PISTOL:
Why, then, let kibes ensue.

FALSTAFF:
There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.

PISTOL:
Young ravens must have food.

FALSTAFF:
Which of you know Ford of this town?

PISTOL:
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.

FALSTAFF:
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

PISTOL:
Two yards, and more.

FALSTAFF:
No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

PISTOL:
He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
out of honesty into English.

NYM:
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?

FALSTAFF:
Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.

PISTOL:
As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.

NYM:
The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.

FALSTAFF:
I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.

PISTOL:
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

NYM:
I thank thee for that humour.

FALSTAFF:
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

PISTOL:
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!

NYM:
I will run no base humour: here, take the
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.

FALSTAFF:

PISTOL:
Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!

NYM:
I have operations which be humours of revenge.

PISTOL:
Wilt thou revenge?

NYM:
By welkin and her star!

PISTOL:
With wit or steel?

NYM:
With both the humours, I:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.

PISTOL:
And I to Ford shall eke unfold
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.

NYM:
My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
deal with poison; I will possess him with
yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
that is my true humour.

PISTOL:
Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
God's patience and the king's English.

RUGBY:
I'll go watch.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?

SIMPLE:
Ay, for fault of a better.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And Master Slender's your master?

SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
glover's paring-knife?

SIMPLE:
No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?

SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
with a warrener.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?

SIMPLE:
Yes, indeed, does he.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--

RUGBY:
Out, alas! here comes my master.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;
go into this closet: he will not stay long.
What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt
he be not well, that he comes not home.
And down, down, adown-a, &c.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.
I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
the young man, he would have been horn-mad.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Is it this, sir?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
is dat knave Rugby?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! John!

RUGBY:
Here, sir!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.

RUGBY:
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!
Rugby, my rapier!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Good master, be content.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Wherefore shall I be content-a?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The young man is an honest man.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
no honest man dat shall come in my closet.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth
of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vell.

SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Peace, I pray you.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.

SIMPLE:
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
master in the way of marriage.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
finger in the fire, and need not.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
Tarry you a little-a while.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:

SIMPLE:

MISTRESS QUICKLY:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
at his dog:

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
will myself have Anne Page.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
door. Follow my heels, Rugby.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
than I do with her, I thank heaven.

FENTON:

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.

FENTON:
How now, good woman? how dost thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.

FENTON:
What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you
that by the way; I praise heaven for it.

FENTON:
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
above your eye?

FENTON:
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
musing: but for you--well, go to.

FENTON:
Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
thou seest her before me, commend me.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your
worship more of the wart the next time we have
confidence; and of other wooers.

FENTON:
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Farewell to your worship.
Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
upon't! what have I forgot?

MISTRESS PAGE:
What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
Let me see.
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
Thine own true knight,
By day or night,
Or any kind of light,
With all his might
For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant! What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

MISTRESS FORD:
Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.

MISTRESS PAGE:
And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
ill.

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Faith, but you do, in my mind.

MISTRESS FORD:
Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!

MISTRESS PAGE:
What's the matter, woman?

MISTRESS FORD:
O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
could come to such honour!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
it? dispense with trifles; what is it?

MISTRESS FORD:
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
I could be knighted.

MISTRESS PAGE:
What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
article of thy gentry.

MISTRESS FORD:
We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
words. What doth he think of us?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.

MISTRESS FORD:
'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
above deck.

MISTRESS PAGE:
So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never
to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
that my husband saw this letter! it would give
eternal food to his jealousy.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.

MISTRESS FORD:
You are the happier woman.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
Come hither.

FORD:
Well, I hope it be not so.

PISTOL:
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
Sir John affects thy wife.

FORD:
Why, sir, my wife is not young.

PISTOL:
He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.

FORD:
Love my wife!

PISTOL:
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
O, odious is the name!

FORD:
What name, sir?

PISTOL:
The horn, I say. Farewell.
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

FORD:

NYM:

PAGE:
'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
frights English out of his wits.

FORD:
I will seek out Falstaff.

PAGE:
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.

FORD:
If I do find it: well.

PAGE:
I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
o' the town commended him for a true man.

FORD:
'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.

PAGE:
How now, Meg!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Whither go you, George? Hark you.

MISTRESS FORD:
How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?

FORD:
I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.

MISTRESS FORD:
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
will you go, Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
to this paltry knight.

MISTRESS FORD:

MISTRESS PAGE:
You are come to see my daughter Anne?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
you.

PAGE:
How now, Master Ford!

FORD:
You heard what this knave told me, did you not?

PAGE:
Yes: and you heard what the other told me?

FORD:
Do you think there is truth in them?

PAGE:
Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
very rogues, now they be out of service.

FORD:
Were they his men?

PAGE:
Marry, were they.

FORD:
I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
the Garter?

PAGE:
Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
lie on my head.

FORD:
I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.

PAGE:
Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:
there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
purse when he looks so merrily.
How now, mine host!

Host:
How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!

SHALLOW:
I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
with us? we have sport in hand.

Host:
Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.

SHALLOW:
Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.

FORD:
Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.

Host:
What sayest thou, my bully-rook?

SHALLOW:

Host:
Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
guest-cavaleire?

FORD:
None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
my name is Brook; only for a jest.

Host:
My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?

SHALLOW:
Have with you, mine host.

PAGE:
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
his rapier.

SHALLOW:
Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.

Host:
Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?

PAGE:
Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.

FORD:
Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,
I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.

FALSTAFF:
I will not lend thee a penny.

PISTOL:
Why, then the world's mine oyster.
Which I with sword will open.

FALSTAFF:
Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
good friends for three reprieves for you and your
coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
mine honour thou hadst it not.

PISTOL:
Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?

FALSTAFF:
Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
honour! You will not do it, you!

PISTOL:
I do relent: what would thou more of man?

ROBIN:
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.

FALSTAFF:
Let her approach.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Give your worship good morrow.

FALSTAFF:
Good morrow, good wife.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Not so, an't please your worship.

FALSTAFF:
Good maid, then.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I'll be sworn,
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.

FALSTAFF:
I do believe the swearer. What with me?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?

FALSTAFF:
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
the hearing.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
Doctor Caius,--

FALSTAFF:
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
come a little nearer this ways.

FALSTAFF:
I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
own people.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!

FALSTAFF:
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
of us, I pray!

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

FALSTAFF:
But what says she to me? be brief, my good
she-Mercury.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
to notify that her husband will be absence from his
house between ten and eleven.

FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
him, good heart.

FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
not fail her.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.

FALSTAFF:
Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
good parts aside I have no other charms.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Blessing on your heart for't!

FALSTAFF:
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
little page, of all loves: her husband has a
marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
send her your page; no remedy.

FALSTAFF:
Why, I will.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
go between you both; and in any case have a
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
the boy never need to understand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any
wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
as they say, and know the world.

FALSTAFF:
Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
this woman.
This news distracts me!

PISTOL:
This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!

FALSTAFF:
Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
fairly done, no matter.

BARDOLPH:
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.

FALSTAFF:
Brook is his name?

BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Call him in.
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
have I encompassed you? go to; via!

FORD:
Bless you, sir!

FALSTAFF:
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?

FORD:
I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
you.

FALSTAFF:
You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.

FORD:
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.

FALSTAFF:
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.

FORD:
Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
for I must let you understand I think myself in
better plight for a lender than you are: the which
hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
ways do lie open.

FALSTAFF:
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.

FORD:
Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
half, for easing me of the carriage.

FALSTAFF:
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.

FORD:
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.

FALSTAFF:
Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
your servant.

FORD:
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
turn another into the register of your own; that I
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.

FALSTAFF:
Very well, sir; proceed.

FORD:
There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
name is Ford.

FALSTAFF:
Well, sir.

FORD:
I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
to give her, but have given largely to many to know
what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'

FALSTAFF:
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?

FORD:
Never.

FALSTAFF:
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

FORD:
Never.

FALSTAFF:
Of what quality was your love, then?

FORD:
Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it.

FALSTAFF:
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

FORD:
When I have told you that, I have told you all.
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
place and person, generally allowed for your many
war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.

FALSTAFF:
O, sir!

FORD:
Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
any.

FALSTAFF:
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.

FORD:
O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
with any detection in my hand, my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselves: I
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
other her defences, which now are too too strongly
embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.

FORD:
O good sir!

FALSTAFF:
I say you shall.

FORD:
Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.

FALSTAFF:
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
know how I speed.

FORD:
I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
sir?

FALSTAFF:
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
and there's my harvest-home.

FORD:
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
if you saw him.

FALSTAFF:
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

FORD:
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
have thought this? See the hell of having a false
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
think in their hearts they may effect, they will
break their hearts but they will effect. God be
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Jack Rugby!

RUGBY:
Sir?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat is de clock, Jack?

RUGBY:
'Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised to meet.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, he has save his soul, dat he is no come; he
has pray his Pible well, dat he is no come: by gar,
Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he be come.

RUGBY:
He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill
him, if he came.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him.
Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.

RUGBY:
Alas, sir, I cannot fence.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Villany, take your rapier.

RUGBY:
Forbear; here's company.

Host:
Bless thee, bully doctor!

SHALLOW:
Save you, Master Doctor Caius!

PAGE:
Now, good master doctor!

SLENDER:
Give you good morrow, sir.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?

Host:
To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee
traverse; to see thee here, to see thee there; to
see thee pass thy punto, thy stock, thy reverse, thy
distance, thy montant. Is he dead, my Ethiopian? is
he dead, my Francisco? ha, bully! What says my
AEsculapius? my Galen? my heart of elder? ha! is
he dead, bully stale? is he dead?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de vorld; he

Host:
Thou art a Castalion-King-Urinal. Hector of Greece, my boy!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I pray you, bear vitness that me have stay six or
seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.

SHALLOW:
He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of
souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should
fight, you go against the hair of your professions.
Is it not true, Master Page?

PAGE:
Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
fighter, though now a man of peace.

SHALLOW:
Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of
the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to
make one. Though we are justices and doctors and
churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our
youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.

PAGE:
'Tis true, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW:
It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
the peace: you have showed yourself a wise
physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise
and patient churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.

Host:
Pardon, guest-justice. A word, Mounseur Mockwater.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Mock-vater! vat is dat?

Host:
Mock-water, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, den, I have as mush mock-vater as de
Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog priest! by gar, me
vill cut his ears.

Host:
He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Clapper-de-claw! vat is dat?

Host:
That is, he will make thee amends.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me;
for, by gar, me vill have it.

Host:
And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Me tank you for dat.

Host:
And, moreover, bully,--but first, master guest, and
Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you
through the town to Frogmore.

PAGE:
Sir Hugh is there, is he?

Host:
He is there: see what humour he is in; and I will
bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?

SHALLOW:
We will do it.

PAGE:
Adieu, good master doctor.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a
jack-an-ape to Anne Page.

Host:
Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
water on thy choler: go about the fields with me
through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress
Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting; and thou
shalt woo her. Cried I aim? said I well?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me dank you for dat: by gar, I love you;
and I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl,
de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.

Host:
For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
Page. Said I well?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis good; vell said.

Host:
Let us wag, then.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
I pray you now, good master Slender's serving-man,
and friend Simple by your name, which way have you
looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?

SIMPLE:
Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward, every
way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town
way.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
I most fehemently desire you you will also look that
way.

SIMPLE:
I will, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and
trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have
deceived me. How melancholies I am! I will knog
his urinals about his knave's costard when I have
good opportunities for the ork. 'Pless my soul!
To shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sings madrigals;
There will we make our peds of roses,
And a thousand fragrant posies.
To shallow--
Mercy on me! I have a great dispositions to cry.
Melodious birds sing madrigals--
When as I sat in Pabylon--
And a thousand vagram posies.
To shallow &c.

SIMPLE:
Yonder he is coming, this way, Sir Hugh.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
He's welcome.
To shallow rivers, to whose falls-
Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?

SIMPLE:
No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over
the stile, this way.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms.

SHALLOW:
How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.
Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
from his book, and it is wonderful.

SLENDER:

PAGE:
'Save you, good Sir Hugh!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!

SHALLOW:
What, the sword and the word! do you study them
both, master parson?

PAGE:
And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this
raw rheumatic day!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
There is reasons and causes for it.

PAGE:
We are come to you to do a good office, master parson.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Fery well: what is it?

PAGE:
Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike
having received wrong by some person, is at most
odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you
saw.

SHALLOW:
I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so
wide of his own respect.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
What is he?

PAGE:
I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the
renowned French physician.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.

PAGE:
Why?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,
--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
would desires to be acquainted withal.

PAGE:
I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.

SHALLOW:

SHALLOW:
It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
here comes Doctor Caius.

PAGE:
Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.

SHALLOW:
So do you, good master doctor.

Host:
Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep
their limbs whole and hack our English.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?

SIR HUGH EVANS:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.

SIR HUGH EVANS:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I
not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place
I did appoint?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the
place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of
the Garter.

Host:
Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
soul-curer and body-curer!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, dat is very good; excellent.

Host:
Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay
their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
follow, follow, follow.

SHALLOW:
Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.

SLENDER:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of
us, ha, ha?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I
desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog
our prains together to be revenge on this same
scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to
be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?

ROBIN:
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
than follow him like a dwarf.

MISTRESS PAGE:
O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.

FORD:
Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?

FORD:
Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want
of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
you two would marry.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Be sure of that,--two other husbands.

FORD:
Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

MISTRESS PAGE:
I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
name, sirrah?

ROBIN:
Sir John Falstaff.

FORD:
Sir John Falstaff!

MISTRESS PAGE:
He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a
league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
home indeed?

FORD:
Indeed she is.

MISTRESS PAGE:
By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.

FORD:
Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
my neighbours shall cry aim.
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
there: I will go.

SHALLOW:
Well met, Master Ford.
&c.

FORD:
Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
and I pray you all go with me.

SHALLOW:
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

SLENDER:
And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
more money than I'll speak of.

SHALLOW:
We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.

SLENDER:
I hope I have your good will, father Page.

PAGE:
You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
Quickly tell me so mush.

Host:
What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
will carry't.

PAGE:
Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.

FORD:
I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.

SHALLOW:
Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
at Master Page's.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

Host:
Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.

FORD:

All:
Have with you to see this monster.

MISTRESS FORD:
What, John! What, Robert!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--

MISTRESS FORD:
I warrant. What, Robin, I say!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, come, come.

MISTRESS FORD:
Here, set it down.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Give your men the charge; we must be brief.

MISTRESS FORD:
Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.

MISTRESS PAGE:
You will do it?

MISTRESS FORD:
I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Here comes little Robin.

MISTRESS FORD:
How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?

ROBIN:
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.

MISTRESS PAGE:
You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?

ROBIN:
Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here and hath threatened to put me into
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
swears he'll turn me away.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
and hose. I'll go hide me.

MISTRESS FORD:
Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.

MISTRESS PAGE:
I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.

MISTRESS FORD:
Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
turtles from jays.

FALSTAFF:
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!

MISTRESS FORD:
O sweet Sir John!

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
best lord; I would make thee my lady.

MISTRESS FORD:
I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!

FALSTAFF:
Let the court of France show me such another. I see
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
Venetian admittance.

MISTRESS FORD:
A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
else; nor that well neither.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.

MISTRESS FORD:
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.

FALSTAFF:
What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
but thee; and thou deservest it.

MISTRESS FORD:
Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.

FALSTAFF:
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
of a lime-kiln.

MISTRESS FORD:
Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
day find it.

FALSTAFF:
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
be in that mind.

ROBIN:

FALSTAFF:
She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.

MISTRESS FORD:
Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
What's the matter? how now!

MISTRESS PAGE:
O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!

MISTRESS FORD:
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE:
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!

MISTRESS FORD:
What cause of suspicion?

MISTRESS PAGE:
What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
mistook in you!

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, alas, what's the matter?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.

MISTRESS FORD:
'Tis not so, I hope.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
one. I come before to tell you. If you know
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.

MISTRESS FORD:
What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
out of the house.

MISTRESS PAGE:
For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

MISTRESS FORD:
He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?

FALSTAFF:

MISTRESS PAGE:
What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?

FALSTAFF:
I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
I'll never--

MISTRESS PAGE:
Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!

MISTRESS FORD:
What, John! Robert! John!
Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.

FORD:
Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?

Servant:
To the laundress, forsooth.

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
were best meddle with buck-washing.

FORD:
Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
and of the season too, it shall appear.
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
So, now uncape.

PAGE:
Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.

FORD:
True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
jealous in France.

PAGE:
Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Is there not a double excellency in this?

MISTRESS FORD:
I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
is deceived, or Sir John.

MISTRESS PAGE:
What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
was in the basket!

MISTRESS FORD:
I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
strain were in the same distress.

MISTRESS FORD:
I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
in his jealousy till now.

MISTRESS PAGE:
I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
scarce obey this medicine.

MISTRESS FORD:
Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
another punishment?

MISTRESS PAGE:
We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
eight o'clock, to have amends.

FORD:
I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
he could not compass.

MISTRESS PAGE:

MISTRESS FORD:
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?

FORD:
Ay, I do so.

MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven make you better than your thoughts!

FORD:
Amen!

MISTRESS PAGE:
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.

FORD:
Ay, ay; I must bear it.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
If there be any pody in the house, and in the
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.

PAGE:
Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
wealth of Windsor Castle.

FORD:
'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
thousand, and five hundred too.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.

FORD:
Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
make known to you why I have done this. Come,
wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
pray heartily, pardon me.

PAGE:
Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?

FORD:
Any thing.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
If there is one, I shall make two in the company.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.

FORD:
Pray you, go, Master Page.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
knave, mine host.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!

FENTON:
I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

ANNE PAGE:
Alas, how then?

FENTON:
Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth--,
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

ANNE PAGE:
May be he tells you true.

FENTON:
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

ANNE PAGE:
Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!

SHALLOW:
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
speak for himself.

SLENDER:
I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
venturing.

SHALLOW:
Be not dismayed.

SLENDER:
No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
but that I am afeard.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.

ANNE PAGE:
I come to him.
This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.

SHALLOW:
She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!

SLENDER:
I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
a pen, good uncle.

SHALLOW:
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

SLENDER:
Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
Gloucestershire.

SHALLOW:
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

SLENDER:
Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
degree of a squire.

SHALLOW:
He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.

ANNE PAGE:
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

SHALLOW:
Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.

ANNE PAGE:
Now, Master Slender,--

SLENDER:
Now, good Mistress Anne,--

ANNE PAGE:
What is your will?

SLENDER:
My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

ANNE PAGE:
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?

SLENDER:
Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
his dole! They can tell you how things go better
than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.

PAGE:
Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.

FENTON:
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

PAGE:
She is no match for you.

FENTON:
Sir, will you hear me?

PAGE:
No, good Master Fenton.
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Speak to Mistress Page.

FENTON:
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.

ANNE PAGE:
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

MISTRESS PAGE:
I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
That's my master, master doctor.

ANNE PAGE:
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
And bowl'd to death with turnips!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy:
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.

FENTON:
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
Master Fenton:' this is my doing.

FENTON:
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Now heaven send thee good fortune!
A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, I say,--

BARDOLPH:
Here, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.

BARDOLPH:
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.

FALSTAFF:
Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
pills to cool the reins. Call her in.

BARDOLPH:
Come in, woman!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
good morrow.

FALSTAFF:
Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
sack finely.

BARDOLPH:
With eggs, sir?

FALSTAFF:
Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
How now!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.

FALSTAFF:
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
between eight and nine: I must carry her word
quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.

FALSTAFF:
Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
and then judge of my merit.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I will tell her.

FALSTAFF:
Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Eight and nine, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Peace be with you, sir.

FALSTAFF:
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.

FORD:
Bless you, sir!

FALSTAFF:
Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
between me and Ford's wife?

FORD:
That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
house the hour she appointed me.

FORD:
And sped you, sir?

FALSTAFF:
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

FORD:
How so, sir? Did she change her determination?

FALSTAFF:
No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.

FORD:
What, while you were there?

FALSTAFF:
While I was there.

FORD:
And did he search for you, and could not find you?

FALSTAFF:
You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.

FORD:
A buck-basket!

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.

FORD:
And how long lay you there?

FALSTAFF:
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.

FORD:
In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
you'll undertake her no more?

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.

FORD:
'Tis past eight already, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
cuckold Ford.

FORD:
Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
guides him should aid him, I will search
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
with me: I'll be horn-mad.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.

MISTRESS PAGE:
I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
'tis a playing-day, I see.
How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Blessing of his heart!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
questions in his accidence.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
master, be not afraid.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
William, how many numbers is in nouns?

WILLIAM PAGE:
Two.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
because they say, ''Od's nouns.'

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE:
Pulcher.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
What is 'lapis,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE:
A stone.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
And what is 'a stone,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE:
A pebble.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.

WILLIAM PAGE:
Lapis.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
That is a good William. What is he, William, that
does lend articles?

WILLIAM PAGE:
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?

WILLIAM PAGE:
Accusativo, hinc.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
accusative, hung, hang, hog.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
case, William?

WILLIAM PAGE:
O,--vocativo, O.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Remember, William; focative is caret.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And that's a good root.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Oman, forbear.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Peace!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
What is your genitive case plural, William?

WILLIAM PAGE:
Genitive case!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Ay.

WILLIAM PAGE:
Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
her, child, if she be a whore.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
For shame, 'oman.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You do ill to teach the child such words: he
teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
I would desires.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Prithee, hold thy peace.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.

WILLIAM PAGE:
Forsooth, I have forgot.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.

MISTRESS PAGE:
He is a better scholar than I thought he was.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
sure of your husband now?

MISTRESS FORD:
He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.

MISTRESS PAGE:

MISTRESS FORD:
Step into the chamber, Sir John.

MISTRESS PAGE:
How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, none but mine own people.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Indeed!

MISTRESS FORD:
No, certainly.
Speak louder.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.

MISTRESS FORD:
Why?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
tameness, civility and patience, to this his
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, does he talk of him?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
the rest of their company from their sport, to make
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.

MISTRESS FORD:
How near is he, Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.

MISTRESS FORD:
I am undone! The knight is here.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
with him! better shame than murder.

FORD:
Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
Shall I put him into the basket again?

FALSTAFF:
No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
out ere he come?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?

FALSTAFF:
What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.

MISTRESS FORD:
There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.

FALSTAFF:
Where is it?

MISTRESS FORD:
He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.

FALSTAFF:
I'll go out then.

MISTRESS PAGE:
If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
John. Unless you go out disguised--

MISTRESS FORD:
How might we disguise him?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.

FALSTAFF:
Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
than a mischief.

MISTRESS FORD:
My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
gown above.

MISTRESS PAGE:
On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
too. Run up, Sir John.

MISTRESS FORD:
Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
look some linen for your head.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
on the gown the while.

MISTRESS FORD:
I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
threatened to beat her.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!

MISTRESS FORD:
But is my husband coming?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.

MISTRESS FORD:
We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
they did last time.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
like the witch of Brentford.

MISTRESS FORD:
I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
We do not act that often jest and laugh;
'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.

MISTRESS FORD:
Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:
your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.

First Servant:
Come, come, take it up.

Second Servant:
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.

First Servant:
I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.

FORD:
Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!

PAGE:
Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!

SHALLOW:
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.

FORD:
So say I too, sir.
Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
without cause, mistress, do I?

MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
any dishonesty.

FORD:
Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!

PAGE:
This passes!

MISTRESS FORD:
Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.

FORD:
I shall find you anon.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
clothes? Come away.

FORD:
Empty the basket, I say!

MISTRESS FORD:
Why, man, why?

FORD:
Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.

MISTRESS FORD:
If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.

PAGE:
Here's no man.

SHALLOW:
By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
wrongs you.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.

FORD:
Well, he's not here I seek for.

PAGE:
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.

FORD:
Help to search my house this one time. If I find
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
once more search with me.

MISTRESS FORD:
What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
down; my husband will come into the chamber.

FORD:
Old woman! what old woman's that?

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.

FORD:
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
you hag, you; come down, I say!

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
not strike the old woman.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.

FORD:
I'll prat her.
Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
I'll fortune-tell you.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
poor woman.

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.

FORD:
Hang her, witch!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
I spy a great peard under his muffler.

FORD:
Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.

PAGE:
Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
gentlemen.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.

MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
unpitifully, methought.

MISTRESS PAGE:
I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
altar; it hath done meritorious service.

MISTRESS FORD:
What think you? may we, with the warrant of
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
pursue him with any further revenge?

MISTRESS PAGE:
The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
way of waste, attempt us again.

MISTRESS FORD:
Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
the ministers.

MISTRESS FORD:
I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
methinks there would be no period to the jest,
should he not be publicly shamed.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would
not have things cool.

BARDOLPH:
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.

Host:
What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen: they speak English?

BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

Host:
They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
command; I have turned away my other guests: they
must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
I did look upon.

PAGE:
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Within a quarter of an hour.

FORD:
Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic,
As firm as faith.

PAGE:
'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence.
But let our plot go forward: let our wives
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.

FORD:
There is no better way than that they spoke of.

PAGE:
How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
no desires.

PAGE:
So think I too.

MISTRESS FORD:
Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
And let us two devise to bring him thither.

MISTRESS PAGE:
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

PAGE:
Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
But what of this?

MISTRESS FORD:
Marry, this is our device;
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.

PAGE:
Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?

MISTRESS PAGE:
That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.

MISTRESS FORD:
And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers.

MISTRESS PAGE:
The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.

FORD:
The children must
Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
knight with my taber.

FORD:
That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.

MISTRESS PAGE:
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.

PAGE:
That silk will I go buy.
And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.

FORD:
Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
honest knaveries.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Go, Mistress Ford,
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

Host:
What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?
speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.

SIMPLE:
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
from Master Slender.

Host:
There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about
with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
unto thee: knock, I say.

SIMPLE:
There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
down; I come to speak with her, indeed.

Host:
Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
host, thine Ephesian, calls.

FALSTAFF:

Host:
Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
fie!

FALSTAFF:
There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
me; but she's gone.

SIMPLE:
Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
Brentford?

FALSTAFF:
Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?

SIMPLE:
My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
chain or no.

FALSTAFF:
I spake with the old woman about it.

SIMPLE:
And what says she, I pray, sir?

FALSTAFF:
Marry, she says that the very same man that
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
it.

SIMPLE:
I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
I had other things to have spoken with her too from
him.

FALSTAFF:
What are they? let us know.

Host:
Ay, come; quick.

SIMPLE:
I may not conceal them, sir.

Host:
Conceal them, or thou diest.

SIMPLE:
Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
have her or no.

FALSTAFF:
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

SIMPLE:
What, sir?

FALSTAFF:
To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.

SIMPLE:
May I be bold to say so, sir?

FALSTAFF:
Ay, sir; like who more bold.

SIMPLE:
I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
with these tidings.

Host:
Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
there a wise woman with thee?

FALSTAFF:
Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
my learning.

BARDOLPH:
Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!

Host:
Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.

BARDOLPH:
Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.

Host:
They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
say they be fled; Germans are honest men.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Where is mine host?

Host:
What is the matter, sir?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

Host:
Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.

Host:
Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!

FALSTAFF:
I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
Now, whence come you?

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
From the two parties, forsooth.

FALSTAFF:
The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
of man's disposition is able to bear.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
white spot about her.

FALSTAFF:
What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
you are so crossed.

FALSTAFF:
Come up into my chamber.

Host:
Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
will give over all.

FENTON:
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

Host:
I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
least keep your counsel.

FENTON:
From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

Host:
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?

FENTON:
Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.

Host:
Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.

FENTON:
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

FALSTAFF:
Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to
get you a pair of horns.

FALSTAFF:
Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
see wonders.

FORD:
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
you had appointed?

FALSTAFF:
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

PAGE:
Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
my daughter.

SLENDER:
Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
that we know one another.

SHALLOW:
That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.

PAGE:
The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
Let's away; follow me.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
see your time, take her by the band, away with her
to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
into the Park: we two must go together.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Fare you well, sir.
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
chiding than a great deal of heart-break.

MISTRESS FORD:
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
Welsh devil Hugh?

MISTRESS PAGE:
They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
display to the night.

MISTRESS FORD:
That cannot choose but amaze him.

MISTRESS PAGE:
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
amazed, he will every way be mocked.

MISTRESS FORD:
We'll betray him finely.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Against such lewdsters and their lechery
Those that betray them do no treachery.

MISTRESS FORD:
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:
be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and
when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:
come, come; trib, trib.

FALSTAFF:
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
doe?

MISTRESS FORD:
Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?

FALSTAFF:
My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.

MISTRESS FORD:
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.

FALSTAFF:
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!

MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas, what noise?

MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven forgive our sins

FALSTAFF:
What should this be?

MISTRESS FORD:
Away, away!

FALSTAFF:
I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
never else cross me thus.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

PISTOL:
Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

FALSTAFF:
They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
About, about;
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

FALSTAFF:
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese!

PISTOL:
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

PISTOL:
A trial, come.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Come, will this wood take fire?

FALSTAFF:
Oh, Oh, Oh!

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire,
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

PAGE:
Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?

MISTRESS PAGE:
I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?

FORD:
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
it, Master Brook.

MISTRESS FORD:
Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
I will never take you for my love again; but I will
always count you my deer.

FALSTAFF:
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

FORD:
Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.

FALSTAFF:
And these are not fairies? I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
ill employment!

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.

FORD:
Well said, fairy Hugh.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.

FORD:
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.

FALSTAFF:
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.

FALSTAFF:
'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?

FORD:
What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

MISTRESS PAGE:
A puffed man?

PAGE:
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?

FORD:
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

PAGE:
And as poor as Job?

FORD:
And as wicked as his wife?

SIR HUGH EVANS:
And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?

FALSTAFF:
Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
me as you will.

FORD:
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
whom you should have been a pander: over and above
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction.

PAGE:
Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
Master Slender hath married her daughter.

MISTRESS PAGE:

SLENDER:
Whoa ho! ho, father Page!

PAGE:
Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?

SLENDER:
Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.

PAGE:
Of what, son?

SLENDER:
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
a postmaster's boy.

PAGE:
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.

SLENDER:
What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
him.

PAGE:
Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
you should know my daughter by her garments?

SLENDER:
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, did you take her in green?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

FORD:
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

PAGE:
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
How now, Master Fenton!

ANNE PAGE:
Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

PAGE:
Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?

MISTRESS PAGE:
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

FENTON:
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

FORD:
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

FALSTAFF:
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.

PAGE:
Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.

FALSTAFF:
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.

MISTRESS PAGE:
Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
Sir John and all.

FORD:
Let it be so. Sir John,
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

AEGEON:
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
If any born at Ephesus be seen
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again: if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

AEGEON:
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.

AEGEON:
A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long, but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
And by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

AEGEON:
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

DUKE SOLINUS:
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

AEGEON:
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother: and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death,
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honour's great disparagement,
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

Gaoler:
I will, my lord.

AEGEON:
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

First Merchant:
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

First Merchant:
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

First Merchant:
Sir, I commend you to your own content.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

ADRIANA:
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA:
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA:
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA:
Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA:
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA:
O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA:
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA:
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA:
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA:
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA:
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA:
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA:
How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA:
Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA:
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
As much or more would we ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA:
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

ADRIANA:
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
can witness.

ADRIANA:
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA:
Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them.

ADRIANA:
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA:
Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

LUCIANA:
Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Quoth my master:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA:
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA:
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And he will bless that cross with other beating:
Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA:
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

LUCIANA:
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA:
His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA:
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

ADRIANA:
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA:
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
a wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
For two; and sound ones too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sure ones, then.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Certain ones then.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
lost by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
to the world's end will have bald followers.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

ADRIANA:
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled that same drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Want wit in all one word to understand.

LUCIANA:
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By me?

ADRIANA:
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I never spake with her in all my life.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
How can she thus then call us by our names,
Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA:
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

LUCIANA:
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

LUCIANA:
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am transformed, master, am I not?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou hast thine own form.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, I am an ape.

LUCIANA:
If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA:
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I'll say as they say and persever so,
And in this mist at all adventures go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

ADRIANA:
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

LUCIANA:
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

OF EPHESUS:
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

BALTHAZAR:
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
welcome dear.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

BALTHAZAR:
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

BALTHAZAR:
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
the street.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
name for an ass.

LUCE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O Lord, I must laugh!
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

LUCE:

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

LUCE:

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou baggage, let me in.

LUCE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, knock the door hard.

LUCE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

LUCE:

ADRIANA:

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

ADRIANA:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

ANGELO:
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
fain have either.

BALTHAZAR:
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
let me in.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

BALTHAZAR:
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.
Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ANGELO:
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

LUCIANA:
And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

LUCIANA:
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

LUCIANA:
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

LUCIANA:
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

LUCIANA:
Why call you me love? call my sister so.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thy sister's sister.

LUCIANA:
That's my sister.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
No;
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

LUCIANA:
All this my sister is, or else should be.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.

LUCIANA:
O, soft, air! hold you still:
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
am I myself?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What claim lays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What complexion is she of?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
That's a fault that water will mend.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What's her name?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
hip to hip.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Then she bears some breadth?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
countries in her.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where Scotland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where France?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
against her heir.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where England?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where Spain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where America, the Indies?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
faith and my heart of steel,
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
me turn i' the wheel.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbour in this town to-night:
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us and we know none,
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
As from a bear a man would run for life,
So fly I from her that would be my wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
There's none but witches do inhabit here;
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

ANGELO:
Master Antipholus,--

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, that's my name.

ANGELO:
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What is your will that I shall do with this?

ANGELO:
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

ANGELO:
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
And then receive my money for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

ANGELO:
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
If any ship put out, then straight away.

Second Merchant:
You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
And since I have not much importuned you;
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
Therefore make present satisfaction,
Or I'll attach you by this officer.

ANGELO:
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus,
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.

Officer:
That labour may you save: see where he comes.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates,
For locking me out of my doors by day.
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
I promised your presence and the chain;
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long,
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

ANGELO:
Saving your merry humour, here's the note
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
I pray you, see him presently discharged,
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I am not furnish'd with the present money;
Besides, I have some business in the town.
Good signior, take the stranger to my house
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

ANGELO:
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

ANGELO:
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
Or else you may return without your money.

ANGELO:
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

Second Merchant:
The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.

ANGELO:
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

ANGELO:
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
Either send the chain or send me by some token.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

Second Merchant:
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I answer you! what should I answer you?

ANGELO:
The money that you owe me for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I owe you none till I receive the chain.

ANGELO:
You know I gave it you half an hour since.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

ANGELO:
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
Consider how it stands upon my credit.

Second Merchant:
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

Officer:
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.

ANGELO:
This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

ANGELO:
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
I would not spare my brother in this case,
If he should scorn me so apparently.

Officer:
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
As all the metal in your shop will answer.

ANGELO:
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
And told thee to what purpose and what end.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I will debate this matter at more leisure
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
Tell her I am arrested in the street
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
On, officer, to prison till it come.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
To Adriana! that is where we dined,
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
Thither I must, although against my will,
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

ADRIANA:
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

LUCIANA:
First he denied you had in him no right.

ADRIANA:
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

LUCIANA:
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

ADRIANA:
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

LUCIANA:
Then pleaded I for you.

ADRIANA:
And what said he?

LUCIANA:
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

ADRIANA:
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

LUCIANA:
With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

ADRIANA:
Didst speak him fair?

LUCIANA:
Have patience, I beseech.

ADRIANA:
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

LUCIANA:
Who would be jealous then of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

ADRIANA:
Ah, but I think him better than I say,
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

LUCIANA:
How hast thou lost thy breath?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By running fast.

ADRIANA:
Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

ADRIANA:
Why, man, what is the matter?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

ADRIANA:
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

ADRIANA:
Go fetch it, sister.
This I wonder at,
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

ADRIANA:
What, the chain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
strikes one.

ADRIANA:
The hours come back! that did I never hear.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
very fear.

ADRIANA:
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
worth, to season.
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

ADRIANA:
Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commodities to buy:
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
forsake your liberty.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I understand thee not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morris-pike.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What, thou meanest an officer?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
give you good rest!'

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
The fellow is distract, and so am I;
And here we wander in illusions:
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

Courtezan:
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, is this Mistress Satan?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
It is the devil.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
written, they appear to men like angels of light:
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

Courtezan:
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
long spoon.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
the devil.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

Courtezan:
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

Courtezan:
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.

Courtezan:
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
And for the same he promised me a chain:
Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad,
Besides this present instance of his rage,
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
But where's the money?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

Officer:
Good sir, be patient.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.

Officer:
Good, now, hold thy tongue.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
your blows.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
rope's-end.'

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Wilt thou still talk?

Courtezan:
How say you now? is not your husband mad?

ADRIANA:
His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.

LUCIANA:
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

Courtezan:
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

PINCH:
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

PINCH:
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
To yield possession to my holy prayers
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

ADRIANA:
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house?

ADRIANA:
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And did not she herself revile me there?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And did not I in rage depart from thence?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

ADRIANA:
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

PINCH:
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

ADRIANA:
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely master, not a rag of money.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

ADRIANA:
He came to me and I deliver'd it.

LUCIANA:
And I am witness with her that she did.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

PINCH:
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

ADRIANA:
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And, gentle master, I received no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

ADRIANA:
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.

ADRIANA:
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

PINCH:
More company! The fiend is strong within him.

LUCIANA:
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
To make a rescue?

Officer:
Masters, let him go
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

PINCH:
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

ADRIANA:
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

Officer:
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me.

ADRIANA:
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
O most unhappy strumpet!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
cry 'The devil!'

LUCIANA:
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

ADRIANA:
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

Officer:
One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

ADRIANA:
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

Officer:
Two hundred ducats.

ADRIANA:
Say, how grows it due?

Officer:
Due for a chain your husband had of him.

ADRIANA:
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

Courtezan:
When as your husband all in rage to-day
Came to my house and took away my ring--
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

ADRIANA:
It may be so, but I did never see it.
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

LUCIANA:
God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

ADRIANA:
And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.

Officer:
Away! they'll kill us.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I see these witches are afraid of swords.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She that would be your wife now ran from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I will not stay to-night for all the town;
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

ANGELO:
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

Second Merchant:
How is the man esteemed here in the city?

ANGELO:
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

Second Merchant:
Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

ANGELO:
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think I had; I never did deny it.

Second Merchant:
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

Second Merchant:
These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
To walk where any honest man resort.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

Second Merchant:
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

ADRIANA:
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
Some get within him, take his sword away:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

AEMELIA:
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

ADRIANA:
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery.

ANGELO:
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

Second Merchant:
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

AEMELIA:
How long hath this possession held the man?

ADRIANA:
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
And much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

AEMELIA:
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

ADRIANA:
To none of these, except it be the last;
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

AEMELIA:
You should for that have reprehended him.

ADRIANA:
Why, so I did.

AEMELIA:
Ay, but not rough enough.

ADRIANA:
As roughly as my modesty would let me.

AEMELIA:
Haply, in private.

ADRIANA:
And in assemblies too.

AEMELIA:
Ay, but not enough.

ADRIANA:
It was the copy of our conference:
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
At board he fed not for my urging it;
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

AEMELIA:
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
And therefore comes it that his head is light.
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

LUCIANA:
She never reprehended him but mildly,
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

ADRIANA:
She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people enter and lay hold on him.

AEMELIA:
No, not a creature enters in my house.

ADRIANA:
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

AEMELIA:
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
Or lose my labour in assaying it.

ADRIANA:
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.

AEMELIA:
Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
To make of him a formal man again:
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

ADRIANA:
I will not hence and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.

AEMELIA:
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

LUCIANA:
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

ADRIANA:
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

Second Merchant:
By this, I think, the dial points at five:
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
The place of death and sorry execution,
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

ANGELO:
Upon what cause?

Second Merchant:
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
Who put unluckily into this bay
Against the laws and statutes of this town,
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

ANGELO:
See where they come: we will behold his death.

LUCIANA:
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
If any friend will pay the sum for him,
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

ADRIANA:
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

DUKE SOLINUS:
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

ADRIANA:
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
At your important letters,--this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street,
With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again and madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
To do him all the grace and good I could.
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
I will determine this before I stir.

Servant:
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
My master and his man are both broke loose,
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
My master preaches patience to him and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
And sure, unless you send some present help,
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

ADRIANA:
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
And that is false thou dost report to us.

Servant:
Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!

DUKE SOLINUS:
Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!

ADRIANA:
Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
That he is borne about invisible:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

AEGEON:
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonour'd me
Even in the strength and height of injury!
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

DUKE SOLINUS:
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

ADRIANA:
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!

LUCIANA:
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
But she tells to your highness simple truth!

ANGELO:
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
My liege, I am advised what I say,
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.

ANGELO:
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

DUKE SOLINUS:
But had he such a chain of thee or no?

ANGELO:
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.

Second Merchant:
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I never came within these abbey-walls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
And this is false you burden me withal.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

Courtezan:
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

Courtezan:
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

AEGEON:
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

AEGEON:
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

AEGEON:
I am sure you both of you remember me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

AEGEON:
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

AEGEON:
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Neither.

AEGEON:
Dromio, nor thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

AEGEON:
I am sure thou dost.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.

AEGEON:
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I never saw my father in my life.

AEGEON:
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

DUKE SOLINUS:
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

AEMELIA:
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

ADRIANA:
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

AEMELIA:
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
And speak unto the same AEmilia!

AEGEON:
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

AEMELIA:
By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, here begins his morning story right;
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And I with him.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

ADRIANA:
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I, gentle mistress.

ADRIANA:
And are not you my husband?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
No; I say nay to that.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother.
What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

ANGELO:
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

ANGELO:
I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

ADRIANA:
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, none by me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these errors are arose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
These ducats pawn I for my father here.

DUKE SOLINUS:
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

Courtezan:
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

AEMELIA:
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
The duke, my husband and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
After so long grief, such festivity!

DUKE SOLINUS:
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There is a fat friend at your master's house,
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not I, sir; you are my elder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That's a question: how shall we try it?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother;
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

Chorus:
O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object: can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Into a thousand parts divide on man,
And make imaginary puissance;
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Admit me Chorus to this history;
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

CANTERBURY:
My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.

ELY:
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

CANTERBURY:
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside,
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.

ELY:
This would drink deep.

CANTERBURY:
'Twould drink the cup and all.

ELY:
But what prevention?

CANTERBURY:
The king is full of grace and fair regard.

ELY:
And a true lover of the holy church.

CANTERBURY:
The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.

ELY:
We are blessed in the change.

CANTERBURY:
Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.

ELY:
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

CANTERBURY:
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.

ELY:
But, my good lord,
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
Incline to it, or no?

CANTERBURY:
He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.

ELY:
How did this offer seem received, my lord?

CANTERBURY:
With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

ELY:
What was the impediment that broke this off?

CANTERBURY:
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

ELY:
It is.

CANTERBURY:
Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

ELY:
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

KING HENRY V:
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

EXETER:
Not here in presence.

KING HENRY V:
Send for him, good uncle.

WESTMORELAND:
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?

KING HENRY V:
Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

CANTERBURY:
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!

KING HENRY V:
Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.

CANTERBURY:
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

KING HENRY V:
May I with right and conscience make this claim?

CANTERBURY:
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English. that could entertain
With half their forces the full Pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!

ELY:
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

EXETER:
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.

WESTMORELAND:
They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
So hath your highness; never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.

CANTERBURY:
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.

KING HENRY V:
We must not only arm to invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
With all advantages.

CANTERBURY:
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

KING HENRY V:
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
With ample and brim fulness of his force,
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
That England, being empty of defence,
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.

CANTERBURY:
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.

WESTMORELAND:
But there's a saying very old and true,
'If that you will France win,
Then with Scotland first begin:'
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.

EXETER:
It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high and low and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.

CANTERBURY:
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.

KING HENRY V:
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
Ruling in large and ample empery
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.

First Ambassador:
May't please your majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

KING HENRY V:
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

First Ambassador:
Thus, then, in few.
Your highness, lately sending into France,
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
In answer of which claim, the prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth,
And bids you be advised there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.

KING HENRY V:
What treasure, uncle?

EXETER:
Tennis-balls, my liege.

KING HENRY V:
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chaces. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days,
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

EXETER:
This was a merry message.

KING HENRY V:
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
That may give furtherance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France,
Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought,
That this fair action may on foot be brought.

Chorus:
Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits Expectation in the air,
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England! model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
The abuse of distance; force a play:
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
The king is set from London; and the scene
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

BARDOLPH:
Well met, Corporal Nym.

NYM:
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.

BARDOLPH:
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

NYM:
For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
endure cold as another man's sword will: and
there's an end.

BARDOLPH:
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
be so, good Corporal Nym.

NYM:
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
rendezvous of it.

BARDOLPH:
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
were troth-plight to her.

NYM:
I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
cannot tell.

BARDOLPH:
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

PISTOL:
Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,
I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

Hostess:
No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and
board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we
shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.

BARDOLPH:
Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.

NYM:
Pish!

PISTOL:
Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!

Hostess:
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.

NYM:
Will you shog off? I would have you solus.

PISTOL:
'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
And flashing fire will follow.

NYM:
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an
humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.

PISTOL:
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;
Therefore exhale.

BARDOLPH:
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

PISTOL:
An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
Thy spirits are most tall.

NYM:
I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair
terms: that is the humour of it.

PISTOL:
'Couple a gorge!'
That is the word. I thee defy again.
O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
No; to the spital go,
And from the powdering tub of infamy
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.

Boy:
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.

BARDOLPH:
Away, you rogue!

Hostess:
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of
these days. The king has killed his heart. Good
husband, come home presently.

BARDOLPH:
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
France together: why the devil should we keep
knives to cut one another's throats?

PISTOL:
Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!

NYM:
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?

PISTOL:
Base is the slave that pays.

NYM:
That now I will have: that's the humour of it.

PISTOL:
As manhood shall compound: push home.

BARDOLPH:
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll
kill him; by this sword, I will.

PISTOL:
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.

BARDOLPH:
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:
an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
Prithee, put up.

NYM:
I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?

PISTOL:
A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:
I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;
Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
Give me thy hand.

NYM:
I shall have my noble?

PISTOL:
In cash most justly paid.

NYM:
Well, then, that's the humour of't.

Hostess:
As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir
John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning
quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to
behold. Sweet men, come to him.

NYM:
The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's
the even of it.

PISTOL:
Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
His heart is fracted and corroborate.

NYM:
The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;
he passes some humours and careers.

PISTOL:
Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.

BEDFORD:
'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.

EXETER:
They shall be apprehended by and by.

WESTMORELAND:
How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

BEDFORD:
The king hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.

EXETER:
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.

KING HENRY V:
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?

SCROOP:
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

KING HENRY V:
I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us.

CAMBRIDGE:
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government.

GREY:
True: those that were your father's enemies
Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.

KING HENRY V:
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
And shall forget the office of our hand,
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness.

SCROOP:
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
To do your grace incessant services.

KING HENRY V:
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
That rail'd against our person: we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on;
And on his more advice we pardon him.

SCROOP:
That's mercy, but too much security:
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

KING HENRY V:
O, let us yet be merciful.

CAMBRIDGE:
So may your highness, and yet punish too.

GREY:
Sir,
You show great mercy, if you give him life,
After the taste of much correction.

KING HENRY V:
Alas, your too much love and care of me
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person,
Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:
Who are the late commissioners?

CAMBRIDGE:
I one, my lord:
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

SCROOP:
So did you me, my liege.

GREY:
And I, my royal sovereign.

KING HENRY V:
Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
Out of appearance?

CAMBRIDGE:
I do confess my fault;
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

GREY:
To which we all appeal.

KING HENRY V:
The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honour; and this man
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
And sworn unto the practises of France,
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
May it be possible, that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural cause,
That admiration did not whoop at them:
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd
From glistering semblances of piety;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back,
And tell the legions 'I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the ear,
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practises!

EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

SCROOP:
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
And I repent my fault more than my death;
Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
Although my body pay the price of it.

CAMBRIDGE:
For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended:
But God be thanked for prevention;
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.

GREY:
Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.
Prevented from a damned enterprise:
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

KING HENRY V:
God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person,
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
Received the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
His princes and his peers to servitude,
His subjects to oppression and contempt
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
You patience to endure, and true repentance
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God,
Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
No king of England, if not king of France.

Hostess:
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.

PISTOL:
No; for my manly heart doth yearn.
Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:
Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,
And we must yearn therefore.

BARDOLPH:
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
heaven or in hell!

Hostess:
Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's
bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made
a finer end and went away an it had been any
christom child; a' parted even just between twelve
and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after
I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew
there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as
a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,
sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' good
cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'
should not think of God; I hoped there was no need
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and
they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and
upward, and all was as cold as any stone.

NYM:
They say he cried out of sack.

Hostess:
Ay, that a' did.

BARDOLPH:
And of women.

Hostess:
Nay, that a' did not.

Boy:
Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils
incarnate.

Hostess:
A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he
never liked.

Boy:
A' said once, the devil would have him about women.

Hostess:
A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then
he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

Boy:
Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
burning in hell-fire?

BARDOLPH:
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
that's all the riches I got in his service.

NYM:
Shall we shog? the king will be gone from
Southampton.

PISTOL:
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables:
Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'
Trust none;
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

Boy:
And that's but unwholesome food they say.

PISTOL:
Touch her soft mouth, and march.

BARDOLPH:
Farewell, hostess.

NYM:
I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.

PISTOL:
Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.

Hostess:
Farewell; adieu.

KING OF FRANCE:
Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.

DAUPHIN:
My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
And let us do it with no show of fear;
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.

Constable:
O peace, Prince Dauphin!
You are too much mistaken in this king:
Question your grace the late ambassadors,
With what great state he heard their embassy,
How well supplied with noble counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution,
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.

DAUPHIN:
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
But though we think it so, it is no matter:
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak or niggardly projection
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.

KING OF FRANCE:
Think we King Harry strong;
And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths:
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
Mangle the work of nature and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him.

Messenger:
Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your majesty.

KING OF FRANCE:
We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.
You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.

DAUPHIN:
Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head:
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.

KING OF FRANCE:
From our brother England?

EXETER:
From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, 'long
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
He sends you this most memorable line,
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing to overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger.

KING OF FRANCE:
Or else what follows?

EXETER:
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threatening and my message;
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

KING OF FRANCE:
For us, we will consider of this further:
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England.

DAUPHIN:
For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him: what to him from England?

EXETER:
Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
And any thing that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordnance.

DAUPHIN:
Say, if my father render fair return,
It is against my will; for I desire
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
As matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls.

EXETER:
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
As we his subjects have in wonder found,
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
In your own losses, if he stay in France.

KING OF FRANCE:
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.

EXETER:
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.

KING OF FRANCE:
You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence.

Chorus:
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
Play with your fancies, and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
You stand upon the ravage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
With one appearing hair, that will not follow
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.

KING HENRY V:
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

BARDOLPH:
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

NYM:
Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;
and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:
the humour of it is too hot, that is the very
plain-song of it.

PISTOL:
The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:
Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
And sword and shield,
In bloody field,
Doth win immortal fame.

Boy:
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.

PISTOL:
And I:
If wishes would prevail with me,
My purpose should not fail with me,
But thither would I hie.

Boy:
As duly, but not as truly,
As bird doth sing on bough.

FLUELLEN:
Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!

PISTOL:
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,
Abate thy rage, great duke!
Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!

NYM:
These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.

Boy:
As young as I am, I have observed these three
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
broke any man's head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
if I should take from another's pocket to put into
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them, and seek some better service:
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
therefore I must cast it up.

GOWER:
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the
mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.

FLUELLEN:
To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good
to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is
not according to the disciplines of the war: the
concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,
the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look
you, is digt himself four yard under the
countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up
all, if there is not better directions.

GOWER:
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the
siege is given, is altogether directed by an
Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

FLUELLEN:
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

GOWER:
I think it be.

FLUELLEN:
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will
verify as much in his beard: be has no more
directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look
you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.

GOWER:
Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

FLUELLEN:
Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,
that is certain; and of great expedition and
knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will
maintain his argument as well as any military man in
the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars
of the Romans.

JAMY:
I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.

FLUELLEN:
God-den to your worship, good Captain James.

GOWER:
How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the
mines? have the pioneers given o'er?

MACMORRIS:
By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give
over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I
swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;
it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so
Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,
tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!

FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you
voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,
as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,
look you, and friendly communication; partly to
satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,
look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of
the military discipline; that is the point.

JAMY:
It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:
and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
occasion; that sall I, marry.

MACMORRIS:
It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the
king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The
town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the
breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:
'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is
throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there
ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!

JAMY:
By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'
the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay
't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,
that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full
fain hear some question 'tween you tway.

FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
correction, there is not many of your nation--

MACMORRIS:
Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,
and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish
my nation? Who talks of my nation?

FLUELLEN:
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is
meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
you do not use me with that affability as in
discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in
other particularities.

MACMORRIS:
I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.

GOWER:
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.

JAMY:
A! that's a foul fault.

GOWER:
The town sounds a parley.

FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better
opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so
bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;
and there is an end.

KING HENRY V:
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit;
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
What is it then to me, if impious war,
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
If not, why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

GOVERNOR:
Our expectation hath this day an end:
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
For we no longer are defensible.

KING HENRY V:
Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

KATHARINE:
Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.

ALICE:
Un peu, madame.

KATHARINE:
Je te prie, m'enseignez: il faut que j'apprenne a
parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglois?

ALICE:
La main? elle est appelee de hand.

KATHARINE:
De hand. Et les doigts?

ALICE:
Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me
souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont
appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.

KATHARINE:
La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
que je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots
d'Anglois vitement. Comment appelez-vous les ongles?

ALICE:
Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.

KATHARINE:
De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi, si je parle bien: de
hand, de fingres, et de nails.

ALICE:
C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglois.

KATHARINE:
Dites-moi l'Anglois pour le bras.

ALICE:
De arm, madame.

KATHARINE:
Et le coude?

ALICE:
De elbow.

KATHARINE:
De elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les
mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.

ALICE:
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.

KATHARINE:
Excusez-moi, Alice; ecoutez: de hand, de fingres,
de nails, de arma, de bilbow.

ALICE:
De elbow, madame.

KATHARINE:
O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! de elbow. Comment
appelez-vous le col?

ALICE:
De neck, madame.

KATHARINE:
De nick. Et le menton?

ALICE:
De chin.

KATHARINE:
De sin. Le col, de nick; de menton, de sin.

ALICE:
Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez
les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.

KATHARINE:
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de Dieu,
et en peu de temps.

ALICE:
N'avez vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?

KATHARINE:
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: de hand, de
fingres, de mails--

ALICE:
De nails, madame.

KATHARINE:
De nails, de arm, de ilbow.

ALICE:
Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

KATHARINE:
Ainsi dis-je; de elbow, de nick, et de sin. Comment
appelez-vous le pied et la robe?

ALICE:
De foot, madame; et de coun.

KATHARINE:
De foot et de coun! O Seigneur Dieu! ce sont mots
de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et
non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais
prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France
pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le coun!
Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon
ensemble: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arm, de
elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.

ALICE:
Excellent, madame!

KATHARINE:
C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.

KING OF FRANCE:
'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

Constable:
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
Let us not live in France; let us quit all
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

DAUPHIN:
O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
And overlook their grafters?

BOURBON:
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
Mort de ma vie! if they march along
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

Constable:
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Poor we may call them in their native lords.

DAUPHIN:
By faith and honour,
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

BOURBON:
They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;
Saying our grace is only in our heels,
And that we are most lofty runaways.

KING OF FRANCE:
Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.

Constable:
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
And for achievement offer us his ransom.

KING OF FRANCE:
Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

DAUPHIN:
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

KING OF FRANCE:
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.

GOWER:
How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?

FLUELLEN:
I assure you, there is very excellent services
committed at the bridge.

GOWER:
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

FLUELLEN:
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;
and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my
heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and
my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and
blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the
bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no
estimation in the world; but did see him do as
gallant service.

GOWER:
What do you call him?

FLUELLEN:
He is called Aunchient Pistol.

GOWER:
I know him not.

FLUELLEN:
Here is the man.

PISTOL:
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

FLUELLEN:
Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at
his hands.

PISTOL:
Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
That goddess blind,
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--

FLUELLEN:
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
Fortune is an excellent moral.

PISTOL:
Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:
A damned death!
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price.
Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

FLUELLEN:
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.

PISTOL:
Why then, rejoice therefore.

FLUELLEN:
Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice
at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.

PISTOL:
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!

FLUELLEN:
It is well.

PISTOL:
The fig of Spain!

FLUELLEN:
Very good.

GOWER:
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I
remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.

FLUELLEN:
I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the
bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,
I warrant you, when time is serve.

GOWER:
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then
goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return
into London under the form of a soldier. And such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:
and they will learn you by rote where services were
done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,
at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was
shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what
a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or
else you may be marvellously mistook.

FLUELLEN:
I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will
tell him my mind.
Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with
him from the pridge.
God pless your majesty!

KING HENRY V:
How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?

FLUELLEN:
Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most
prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to
retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a
prave man.

KING HENRY V:
What men have you lost, Fluellen?

FLUELLEN:
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I
think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that
is like to be executed for robbing a church, one
Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'
fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like
a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;
but his nose is executed and his fire's out.

KING HENRY V:
We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we
give express charge, that in our marches through the
country, there be nothing compelled from the
villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner.

MONTJOY:
You know me by my habit.

KING HENRY V:
Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?

MONTJOY:
My master's mind.

KING HENRY V:
Unfold it.

MONTJOY:
Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:
Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom; which must
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
my king and master; so much my office.

KING HENRY V:
What is thy name? I know thy quality.

MONTJOY:
Montjoy.

KING HENRY V:
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
My numbers lessened, and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
That I do brag thus! This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
My army but a weak and sickly guard;
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
Go bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle, as we are;
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
So tell your master.

MONTJOY:
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope they will not come upon us now.

KING HENRY V:
We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
And on to-morrow, bid them march away.

Constable:
Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!

ORLEANS:
You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.

Constable:
It is the best horse of Europe.

ORLEANS:
Will it never be morning?

DAUPHIN:
My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
talk of horse and armour?

ORLEANS:
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.

DAUPHIN:
What a long night is this! I will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

ORLEANS:
He's of the colour of the nutmeg.

DAUPHIN:
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
may call beasts.

Constable:
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

DAUPHIN:
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.

ORLEANS:
No more, cousin.

DAUPHIN:
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:
'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the
world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him. I
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
'Wonder of nature,'--

ORLEANS:
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.

DAUPHIN:
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
courser, for my horse is my mistress.

ORLEANS:
Your mistress bears well.

DAUPHIN:
Me well; which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress.

Constable:
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back.

DAUPHIN:
So perhaps did yours.

Constable:
Mine was not bridled.

DAUPHIN:
O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,
like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
your straight strossers.

Constable:
You have good judgment in horsemanship.

DAUPHIN:
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
my horse to my mistress.

Constable:
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

DAUPHIN:
I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.

Constable:
I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
to my mistress.

DAUPHIN:
'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et
la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.

Constable:
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.

RAMBURES:
My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?

Constable:
Stars, my lord.

DAUPHIN:
Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.

Constable:
And yet my sky shall not want.

DAUPHIN:
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
'twere more honour some were away.

Constable:
Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.

DAUPHIN:
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
my way shall be paved with English faces.

Constable:
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
fain be about the ears of the English.

RAMBURES:
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?

Constable:
You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.

DAUPHIN:
'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.

ORLEANS:
The Dauphin longs for morning.

RAMBURES:
He longs to eat the English.

Constable:
I think he will eat all he kills.

ORLEANS:
By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

Constable:
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

ORLEANS:
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.

Constable:
Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

ORLEANS:
He never did harm, that I heard of.

Constable:
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.

ORLEANS:
I know him to be valiant.

Constable:
I was told that by one that knows him better than
you.

ORLEANS:
What's he?

Constable:
Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared
not who knew it

ORLEANS:
He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.

Constable:
By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
appears, it will bate.

ORLEANS:
Ill will never said well.

Constable:
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'

ORLEANS:
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'

Constable:
Well placed: there stands your friend for the
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
pox of the devil.'

ORLEANS:
You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A
fool's bolt is soon shot.'

Constable:
You have shot over.

ORLEANS:
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.

Messenger:
My lord high constable, the English lie within
fifteen hundred paces of your tents.

Constable:
Who hath measured the ground?

Messenger:
The Lord Grandpre.

Constable:
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
the dawning as we do.

ORLEANS:
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so
far out of his knowledge!

Constable:
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.

ORLEANS:
That they lack; for if their heads had any
intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy
head-pieces.

RAMBURES:
That island of England breeds very valiant
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

ORLEANS:
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.

Constable:
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
their wits with their wives: and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils.

ORLEANS:
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.

Constable:
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
come, shall we about it?

ORLEANS:
It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

Chorus:
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each other's watch:
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation:
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and over-lusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruin'd band
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night,
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

KING HENRY V:
Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
Would men observingly distil it out.
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
Besides, they are our outward consciences,
And preachers to us all, admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
And make a moral of the devil himself.
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.

ERPINGHAM:
Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'

KING HENRY V:
'Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
Commend me to the princes in our camp;
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
Desire them an to my pavilion.

GLOUCESTER:
We shall, my liege.

ERPINGHAM:
Shall I attend your grace?

KING HENRY V:
No, my good knight;
Go with my brothers to my lords of England:
I and my bosom must debate awhile,
And then I would no other company.

ERPINGHAM:
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!

KING HENRY V:
God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.

PISTOL:
Qui va la?

KING HENRY V:
A friend.

PISTOL:
Discuss unto me; art thou officer?
Or art thou base, common and popular?

KING HENRY V:
I am a gentleman of a company.

PISTOL:
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?

KING HENRY V:
Even so. What are you?

PISTOL:
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

KING HENRY V:
Then you are a better than the king.

PISTOL:
The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?

KING HENRY V:
Harry le Roy.

PISTOL:
Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?

KING HENRY V:
No, I am a Welshman.

PISTOL:
Know'st thou Fluellen?

KING HENRY V:
Yes.

PISTOL:
Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
Upon Saint Davy's day.

KING HENRY V:
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,
lest he knock that about yours.

PISTOL:
Art thou his friend?

KING HENRY V:
And his kinsman too.

PISTOL:
The figo for thee, then!

KING HENRY V:
I thank you: God be with you!

PISTOL:
My name is Pistol call'd.

KING HENRY V:
It sorts well with your fierceness.

GOWER:
Captain Fluellen!

FLUELLEN:
So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is
the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the
cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety
of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.

GOWER:
Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.

FLUELLEN:
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,
look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?

GOWER:
I will speak lower.

FLUELLEN:
I pray you and beseech you that you will.

KING HENRY V:
Though it appear a little out of fashion,
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.

COURT:
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
breaks yonder?

BATES:
I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
the approach of day.

WILLIAMS:
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think
we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?

KING HENRY V:
A friend.

WILLIAMS:
Under what captain serve you?

KING HENRY V:
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

WILLIAMS:
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
pray you, what thinks he of our estate?

KING HENRY V:
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
washed off the next tide.

BATES:
He hath not told his thought to the king?

KING HENRY V:
No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
it, should dishearten his army.

BATES:
He may show what outward courage he will; but I
believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

KING HENRY V:
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:
I think he would not wish himself any where but
where he is.

BATES:
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.

KING HENRY V:
I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
minds: methinks I could not die any where so
contented as in the king's company; his cause being
just and his quarrel honourable.

WILLIAMS:
That's more than we know.

BATES:
Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
the crime of it out of us.

WILLIAMS:
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a
surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
well that die in a battle; for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
will be a black matter for the king that led them to
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection.

KING HENRY V:
So, if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
servant, under his master's command transporting a
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
business of the master the author of the servant's
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
they feared the death, they have borne life away;
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
that, making God so free an offer, He let him
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare.

WILLIAMS:
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
his own head, the king is not to answer it.

BATES:
But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

KING HENRY V:
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.

WILLIAMS:
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
ne'er the wiser.

KING HENRY V:
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.

WILLIAMS:
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.

KING HENRY V:
Your reproof is something too round: I should be
angry with you, if the time were convenient.

WILLIAMS:
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

KING HENRY V:
I embrace it.

WILLIAMS:
How shall I know thee again?

KING HENRY V:
Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
will make it my quarrel.

WILLIAMS:
Here's my glove: give me another of thine.

KING HENRY V:
There.

WILLIAMS:
This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.

KING HENRY V:
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

WILLIAMS:
Thou darest as well be hanged.

KING HENRY V:
Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
king's company.

WILLIAMS:
Keep thy word: fare thee well.

BATES:
Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.

KING HENRY V:
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to
one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their
shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
be a clipper.
Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
Our debts, our careful wives,
Our children and our sins lay on the king!
We must bear all. O hard condition,
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
What is thy soul of adoration?
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
Creating awe and fear in other men?
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
Than they in fearing.
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;
I am a king that find thee, and I know
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running 'fore the king,
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
And follows so the ever-running year,
With profitable labour, to his grave:
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
The slave, a member of the country's peace,
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

ERPINGHAM:
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
Seek through your camp to find you.

KING HENRY V:
Good old knight,
Collect them all together at my tent:
I'll be before thee.

ERPINGHAM:
I shall do't, my lord.

KING HENRY V:
O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
Possess them not with fear; take from them now
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
My father made in compassing the crown!
I Richard's body have interred anew;
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up
Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after all,
Imploring pardon.

GLOUCESTER:
My liege!

KING HENRY V:
My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;
I know thy errand, I will go with thee:
The day, my friends and all things stay for me.

ORLEANS:
The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!

DAUPHIN:
Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!

ORLEANS:
O brave spirit!

DAUPHIN:
Via! les eaux et la terre.

ORLEANS:
Rien puis? L'air et la feu.

DAUPHIN:
Ciel, cousin Orleans.
Now, my lord constable!

Constable:
Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!

DAUPHIN:
Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

RAMBURES:
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?

Messenger:
The English are embattled, you French peers.

Constable:
To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands;
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
Who in unnecessary action swarm
About our squares of battle, were enow
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
Though we upon this mountain's basis by
Took stand for idle speculation:
But that our honours must not. What's to say?
A very little little let us do.
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
For our approach shall so much dare the field
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

GRANDPRE:
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
Ill-favouredly become the morning field:
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,
With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;
And their executors, the knavish crows,
Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.

Constable:
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.

DAUPHIN:
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?

Constable:
I stay but for my guidon: to the field!
I will the banner from a trumpet take,
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.

GLOUCESTER:
Where is the king?

BEDFORD:
The king himself is rode to view their battle.

WESTMORELAND:
Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.

EXETER:
There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.

SALISBURY:
God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!

BEDFORD:
Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!

EXETER:
Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.

BEDFORD:
He is full of valour as of kindness;
Princely in both.

WESTMORELAND:
O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!

KING HENRY V:
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

SALISBURY:
My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:
The French are bravely in their battles set,
And will with all expedience charge on us.

KING HENRY V:
All things are ready, if our minds be so.

WESTMORELAND:
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

KING HENRY V:
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

WESTMORELAND:
God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!

KING HENRY V:
Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;
Which likes me better than to wish us one.
You know your places: God be with you all!

MONTJOY:
Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
Before thy most assured overthrow:
For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
Thy followers of repentance; that their souls
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
Must lie and fester.

KING HENRY V:
Who hath sent thee now?

MONTJOY:
The Constable of France.

KING HENRY V:
I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion's skin
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Mark then abounding valour in our English,
That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,
Break out into a second course of mischief,
Killing in relapse of mortality.
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There's not a piece of feather in our host--
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.

MONTJOY:
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.

KING HENRY V:
I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.

YORK:
My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
The leading of the vaward.

KING HENRY V:
Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!

PISTOL:
Yield, cur!

French Soldier:
Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.

PISTOL:
Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
what is thy name? discuss.

French Soldier:
O Seigneur Dieu!

PISTOL:
O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:
Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;
O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
Except, O signieur, thou do give to me
Egregious ransom.

French Soldier:
O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!

PISTOL:
Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
In drops of crimson blood.

French Soldier:
Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?

PISTOL:
Brass, cur!
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
Offer'st me brass?

French Soldier:
O pardonnez moi!

PISTOL:
Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?
Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
What is his name.

Boy:
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?

French Soldier:
Monsieur le Fer.

Boy:
He says his name is Master Fer.

PISTOL:
Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret
him: discuss the same in French unto him.

Boy:
I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.

PISTOL:
Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.

French Soldier:
Que dit-il, monsieur?

Boy:
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous
pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette
heure de couper votre gorge.

PISTOL:
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,
Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.

French Soldier:
O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me
pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:
gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.

PISTOL:
What are his words?

Boy:
He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of
a good house; and for his ransom he will give you
two hundred crowns.

PISTOL:
Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.

French Soldier:
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

Boy:
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner
aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous
l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la
liberte, le franchisement.

French Soldier:
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et
je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les
mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.

PISTOL:
Expound unto me, boy.

Boy:
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and
he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into
the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.

PISTOL:
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
Follow me!

Boy:
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
I did never know so full a voice issue from so
empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty
vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym
had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
the old play, that every one may pare his nails with
a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so
would this be, if he durst steal any thing
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with
the luggage of our camp: the French might have a
good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is
none to guard it but boys.

Constable:
O diable!

ORLEANS:
O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!

DAUPHIN:
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
Reproach and everlasting shame
Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!
Do not run away.

Constable:
Why, all our ranks are broke.

DAUPHIN:
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?

ORLEANS:
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?

BOURBON:
Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
Let us die in honour: once more back again;
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,
Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
His fairest daughter is contaminated.

Constable:
Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

ORLEANS:
We are enow yet living in the field
To smother up the English in our throngs,
If any order might be thought upon.

BOURBON:
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:
Let life be short; else shame will be too long.

KING HENRY V:
Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.

EXETER:
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

KING HENRY V:
Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.

EXETER:
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry!'
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
Commend my service to me sovereign.'
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
But I had not so much of man in me,
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.

KING HENRY V:
I blame you not;
For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.
But, hark! what new alarum is this same?
The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:
Then every soldier kill his prisoners:
Give the word through.

FLUELLEN:
Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly
against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of
knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your
conscience, now, is it not?

GOWER:
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the
cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done
this slaughter: besides, they have burned and
carried away all that was in the king's tent;
wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every
soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
gallant king!

FLUELLEN:
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What
call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!

GOWER:
Alexander the Great.

FLUELLEN:
Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the
great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase
is a little variations.

GOWER:
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his
father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.

FLUELLEN:
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I
tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the
'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,
look you, is both alike. There is a river in
Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other
river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is
to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you
mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life
is come after it indifferent well; for there is
figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and
you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his
wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and
his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

GOWER:
Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
any of his friends.

FLUELLEN:
It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out
of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in
his right wits and his good judgments, turned away
the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he
was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and
mocks; I have forgot his name.

GOWER:
Sir John Falstaff.

FLUELLEN:
That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.

GOWER:
Here comes his majesty.

KING HENRY V:
I was not angry since I came to France
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
Or void the field; they do offend our sight:
If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

EXETER:
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

GLOUCESTER:
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.

KING HENRY V:
How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Comest thou again for ransom?

MONTJOY:
No, great king:
I come to thee for charitable licence,
That we may wander o'er this bloody field
To look our dead, and then to bury them;
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes--woe the while!--
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
To view the field in safety and dispose
Of their dead bodies!

KING HENRY V:
I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no;
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop o'er the field.

MONTJOY:
The day is yours.

KING HENRY V:
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?

MONTJOY:
They call it Agincourt.

KING HENRY V:
Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

FLUELLEN:
Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your
majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack
Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,
fought a most prave pattle here in France.

KING HENRY V:
They did, Fluellen.

FLUELLEN:
Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is
remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their
Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this
hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do
believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek
upon Saint Tavy's day.

KING HENRY V:
I wear it for a memorable honour;
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

FLUELLEN:
All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's
Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases
his grace, and his majesty too!

KING HENRY V:
Thanks, good my countryman.

FLUELLEN:
By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not
who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I
need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be
God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.

KING HENRY V:
God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.

EXETER:
Soldier, you must come to the king.

KING HENRY V:
Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?

WILLIAMS:
An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that
I should fight withal, if he be alive.

KING HENRY V:
An Englishman?

WILLIAMS:
An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered
with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to
challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box
o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,
which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear
if alive, I will strike it out soundly.

KING HENRY V:
What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this
soldier keep his oath?

FLUELLEN:
He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your
majesty, in my conscience.

KING HENRY V:
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,
quite from the answer of his degree.

FLUELLEN:
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as
Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look
your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if
he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as
arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black
shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my
conscience, la!

KING HENRY V:
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.

WILLIAMS:
So I will, my liege, as I live.

KING HENRY V:
Who servest thou under?

WILLIAMS:
Under Captain Gower, my liege.

FLUELLEN:
Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and
literatured in the wars.

KING HENRY V:
Call him hither to me, soldier.

WILLIAMS:
I will, my liege.

KING HENRY V:
Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and
stick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself were
down together, I plucked this glove from his helm:
if any man challenge this, he is a friend to
Alencon, and an enemy to our person; if thou
encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.

FLUELLEN:
Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be
desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain
see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find
himself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but I
would fain see it once, an please God of his grace
that I might see.

KING HENRY V:
Knowest thou Gower?

FLUELLEN:
He is my dear friend, an please you.

KING HENRY V:
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.

FLUELLEN:
I will fetch him.

KING HENRY V:
My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:
The glove which I have given him for a favour
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;
It is the soldier's; I by bargain should
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
For I do know Fluellen valiant
And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury:
Follow and see there be no harm between them.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

WILLIAMS:
I warrant it is to knight you, captain.

FLUELLEN:
God's will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you
now, come apace to the king: there is more good
toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.

WILLIAMS:
Sir, know you this glove?

FLUELLEN:
Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.

WILLIAMS:
I know this; and thus I challenge it.

FLUELLEN:
'Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the
universal world, or in France, or in England!

GOWER:
How now, sir! you villain!

WILLIAMS:
Do you think I'll be forsworn?

FLUELLEN:
Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his
payment into ploughs, I warrant you.

WILLIAMS:
I am no traitor.

FLUELLEN:
That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his
majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the
Duke Alencon's.

WARWICK:
How now, how now! what's the matter?

FLUELLEN:
My Lord of Warwick, here is--praised be God for it!
--a most contagious treason come to light, look
you, as you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is
his majesty.

KING HENRY V:
How now! what's the matter?

FLUELLEN:
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,
look your grace, has struck the glove which your
majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.

WILLIAMS:
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of
it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to
wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he
did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I
have been as good as my word.

FLUELLEN:
Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's
manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy
knave it is: I hope your majesty is pear me
testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that
this is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty is
give me; in your conscience, now?

KING HENRY V:
Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the
fellow of it.
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

FLUELLEN:
An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,
if there is any martial law in the world.

KING HENRY V:
How canst thou make me satisfaction?

WILLIAMS:
All offences, my lord, come from the heart: never
came any from mine that might offend your majesty.

KING HENRY V:
It was ourself thou didst abuse.

WILLIAMS:
Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to
me but as a common man; witness the night, your
garments, your lowliness; and what your highness
suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for
your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I
took you for, I made no offence; therefore, I
beseech your highness, pardon me.

KING HENRY V:
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

FLUELLEN:
By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle
enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence
for you; and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you
out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and
dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.

WILLIAMS:
I will none of your money.

FLUELLEN:
It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will
serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should
you be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis
a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.

KING HENRY V:
Now, herald, are the dead number'd?

Herald:
Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.

KING HENRY V:
What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?

EXETER:
Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;
John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

KING HENRY V:
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
One hundred twenty six: added to these,
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;
Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,
John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,
The brother of the Duke of Burgundy,
And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,
Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,
Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
Here was a royal fellowship of death!
Where is the number of our English dead?
Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:
None else of name; and of all other men
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
But in plain shock and even play of battle,
Was ever known so great and little loss
On one part and on the other? Take it, God,
For it is none but thine!

EXETER:
'Tis wonderful!

KING HENRY V:
Come, go we in procession to the village.
And be it death proclaimed through our host
To boast of this or take the praise from God
Which is his only.

FLUELLEN:
Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tell
how many is killed?

KING HENRY V:
Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,
That God fought for us.

FLUELLEN:
Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.

KING HENRY V:
Do we all holy rites;
Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;'
The dead with charity enclosed in clay:
And then to Calais; and to England then:
Where ne'
