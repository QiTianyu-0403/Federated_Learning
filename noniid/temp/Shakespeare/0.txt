All:
Speak, speak.

All:
Resolved. resolved.

All:
We know't, we know't.

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

All:
Come, come.

COMINIUS:
You have fought together.

COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

BRUTUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS:
And keep your honours safe!

All:
Farewell.

All:
To the pot, I warrant him.

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy news?

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?

COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with Titus Lartius?

COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose.

COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

COMINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done--before our army hear me.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

Both:
Well, sir.

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.

BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.

BRUTUS:
What then, sir?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.

All:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
O my sweet lady, pardon.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

CORIOLANUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.

BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the event.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

BRUTUS:
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I love them as they weigh.

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.

CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!

BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.

BRUTUS:
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
I know, they do attend us.

All:
Content, content.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine own desire.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
good voice, sir; what say you?

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms: adieu.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

All Citizens:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?

CORIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.

BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ancestor.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

All:
We will so: almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

COMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?

BRUTUS:
The people are incensed against him.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

CORIOLANUS:
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

COMINIUS:
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

BRUTUS:
Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with him! down with him!

Citizens:
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

Citizens:
True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

Citizens:
You so remain.

COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with him, down with him!

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

BRUTUS:
He consul!

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,--

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

CORIOLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
That always favour'd him.

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

AEdile:
I have.

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.

AEdile:
Very well.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

AEdile:
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

CORIOLANUS:
I am content.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

BRUTUS:
But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
I know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

BRUTUS:
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

Citizens:
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

CORIOLANUS:
Give me thy hand: Come.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.

BRUTUS:
Why?

BRUTUS:
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

BRUTUS:
Well, well, we'll leave you.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you?

Citizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and crows.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, take
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

All:
In, in, in, in!

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes:
Farewell, farewell.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

COMINIUS:
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

COMINIUS:
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.

BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein show'd like enemies.

COMINIUS:
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rome can make against them.

Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful news.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
when he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

COMINIUS:
He would not seem to know me.

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him.

COMINIUS:
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

CORIOLANUS:
What's the matter?

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.

CORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!

CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.

CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.

All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Most welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

AUFIDIUS:
That I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the lords.

All The Lords:
You are most welcome home.

AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shall hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

AUFIDIUS:
My noble masters, hear me speak.

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

CLARENCE:
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

BRAKENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Both:
To, to, to--

CLARENCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.

DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

DORSET:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

DORSET:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

Boy:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay, boy.

Boy:
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Boy:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

Children:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

Children:
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry with the child.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
That he will not be won to aught against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
To sit about the coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.

CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared and look not for it.

CATESBY:
The princes both make high account of you;
For they account his head upon the bridge.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence.

BUCKINGHAM:

BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
strawberries.

DERBY:
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?

DERBY:
I pray God he be not, I say.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency defend and guard us!

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
'This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
And even here brake off, and came away.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
What says he?

CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his grace.

CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESBY:
My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
And so once more return and tell his grace.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If non to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for ever may they last!

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.

CATESBY:

CATESBY:
My lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness to my just demand?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

CATESBY:
My lord!

CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently hear my impatience.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

CATESBY:
I go.

CATESBY:
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

CATESBY:
If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

CATESBY:
My lord?

DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

DERBY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

All:

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

DERBY:
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father's death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

DUCHESS:
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her companion grief must end her life.

DUCHESS:
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
I take my leave before I have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
For nothing but his majesty's approach.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let paper show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your majesty to visit him.

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

All:
Amen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

DUKE OF YORK:
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
And not against his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never would compare between.

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you parted with the king,
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition.

BUSHY:
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

BUSHY:
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

BUSHY:
Despair not, madam.

DUKE OF YORK:
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Hold, take my ring.

DUKE OF YORK:
What is't, knave?

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
And every thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible.

BAGOT:
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go along with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.

BUSHY:
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, never.

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
And minister correction to thy fault!

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time,
In braving arms against thy sovereign.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right;
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
Be his own carver and cut out his way,
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night.

DUKE OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Things past redress are now with me past care.

Captain:
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Captain:
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
As well assured Richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

DUKE OF YORK:
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
With letters of your love to her at large.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke my father with his power?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, one word.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

DUKE OF YORK:
The time hath been,
Would you have been so brief with him, he would
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a show!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

BAGOT:
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

BAGOT:
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from the restful English court
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer twenty thousand such as you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant country's earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O, if you raise this house against this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke.

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sad stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YORK:
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord, they do.

DUKE OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If God prevent not, I purpose so.

DUKE OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF YORK:
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
I will appeach the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, foolish woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou fond mad woman,
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their hands,
To kill the king at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like to me, or any of my kin,
And yet I love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the king?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

DUKE OF YORK:

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.

DUKE OF YORK:

DUKE OF YORK:
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

DUKE OF YORK:
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not sue to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

EXTON:
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
Was it not so?

EXTON:
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice together, did he not?

EXTON:
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

EXTON:
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
This dead king to the living king I'll bear
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.

EXTON:
Great king, within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

EXTON:
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

BENVOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?

BENVOLIO:
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

BENVOLIO:
In love?

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.

BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.

BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it?

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

CAPULET:
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

CAPULET:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.

Chorus:
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

BENVOLIO:
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
The what?

BENVOLIO:
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

BENVOLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capulets.

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

BENVOLIO:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?

BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.

CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

CAPULET:
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.

CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

CAPULET:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

CAPULET:
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.

CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's there?

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

CAPULET:
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

CAPULET:
All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.

Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

BALTHASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

BALTHASAR:

BALTHASAR:
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

BALTHASAR:
I dare not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true, father, behold his blood.

CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York.

EXETER:
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

EXETER:
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.

EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?

CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.

EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!

EXETER:
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!

EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
I'll steal away.

EXETER:
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.

EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight contention.

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end.

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.

CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.

CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.

CLIFFORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.

CLIFFORD:
That is my office, for my father's sake.

CLIFFORD:
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.

EDWARD:
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!

EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

CLIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

CLIFFORD:
I would your highness would depart the field:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.

EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And set thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot out me, and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you fled.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
To make this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

EDWARD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey,
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so, have at thee!

EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I'll away before.

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
More than my body's parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

CLARENCE:
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.

BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

BONA:
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

BONA:
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.

BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

CLARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

CLARENCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.

CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be determined.

CLARENCE:
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

All:
Long live Edward the Fourth!

CLARENCE:
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

EXETER:
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?

EDWARD:
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me with perjury.

CLARENCE:
What? what?

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

CLARENCE:
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.

CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.

CAMILLO:
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one.

CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it still came home.

CAMILLO:
He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.

CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee,--

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!

CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

CAMILLO:
I may not answer.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

CAMILLO:
By the king.

CAMILLO:
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

CAMILLO:
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
My fortunes to your service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

ANTIGONUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

ANTIGONUS:

EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
She is something before her time deliver'd.

EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
I am innocent as you.'

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, I'll presently
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be denied.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by this good light.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

ANTIGONUS:
I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

DION:
I shall report,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I was nothing.

DION:
If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!

CLEOMENES:
All this we swear.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

ANTIGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Clown:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a bodkin's point.

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the sea or weather.

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
now.

Clown:
I would you had been by the ship side, to have
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command.

AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale moon shines by night:
And when I wander here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account I well may, give,
And in the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
me.

Clown:
What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
that kills my heart.

Clown:
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
him.

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

CAMILLO:
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

CAMILLO:
He tells her something
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, strike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!

Clown:
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!

Clown:
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

Clown:
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Clown:
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

Clown:
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, and not a word more.

Clown:
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

Clown:
What hast here? ballads?

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

DORCAS:
Whither?

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.

Clown:
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You know your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not before him.

CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

CAMILLO:
This is desperate, sir.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

CAMILLO:
Then list to me:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these
seven years
Be born another such.

CAMILLO:
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.

CAMILLO:
Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO:
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
there's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough.

CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done there?

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

CAMILLO:

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS:

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown:
We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us the lie.

Clown:
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner.

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.

AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown:
This cannot be but a great courtier.

Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
know the king is full of grief.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown:
Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown:
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
shall do it.

Clown:
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I promised?

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you.

Clown:
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.

DION:
If you would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?

CLEOMENES:
You tempt him over-much.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

AUTOLYCUS:
I would most gladly know the issue of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret, it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worship.

Clown:
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear it.

Clown:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
good masters.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.

ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.

CLAUDIO:
No.

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Where is the provost?

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW:
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

ANGELO:
What are you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
How know you that?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.

ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he misplaces?

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

ESCALUS:
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.

ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS:
Where were you born, friend?

ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

ESCALUS:
Your mistress' name?

ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
name, Master tapster?

ESCALUS:
What else?

ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.

ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'clock, think you?

ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.

ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?

ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.

ANGELO:
Stay a little while.
You're welcome: what's your will?

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.

ANGELO:
I will not do't.

ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

ANGELO:
Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

ANGELO:
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ANGELO:

ANGELO:
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ANGELO:
How! bribe me?

ANGELO:
Well; come to me to-morrow.

ANGELO:

ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.

ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!

ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How now! who's there?

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
How now, fair maid?

ANGELO:
That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ANGELO:
Yea.

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ANGELO:
Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?

ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.

ANGELO:
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

ANGELO:
We are all frail.

ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.

ANGELO:
I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?

CLAUDIO:
But is there any?

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.

CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

CLAUDIO:
O hear me, Isabella!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,--and now follows
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here

ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should he be made, then?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question but he was.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he die, sir?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to prison!

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
no more words.
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
so with him.

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief.

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's some in hope.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Now are they come.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is now apparent?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delaying death.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

ABHORSON:
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

ESCALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver me
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most likely!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.

ANGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!

ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

ANGELO:
I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said.

ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis false.

ESCALUS:
How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio's death.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is that Barnardine?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

A Player:
So please your lordship to accept our duty.

A Player:
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.

A Player:
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.

ALL:
Amen.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you both love Katharina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to took and practise by myself.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

BIONDELLO:
The better for him: would I were so too!

BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?

BIANCA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

BAPTISTA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?

BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's her dower?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

BIANCA:
Construe them.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

BIANCA:

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.

BAPTISTA:

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?

BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the event of this.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?

CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

CURTIS:
How?

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.

CURTIS:
Here.

CURTIS:
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

CURTIS:
Both of one horse?

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

CURTIS:
They are.

CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.

ALL SERVING-MEN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

BIONDELLO:

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Cambio!

BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.

BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.

BAPTISTA:
What, is the man lunatic?

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?

BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.

BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.

Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?

Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the king.

ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.

ARIEL:
My liberty.

ARIEL:
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.

ARIEL:
No.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

ARIEL:
No, sir.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

CALIBAN:

ARIEL:
My lord it shall be done.

CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

CALIBAN:
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of him.

FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

FERDINAND:
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

FERDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.

FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.

ANTONIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert,--

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.

ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

ANTONIO:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished for.

ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.

ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

ANTONIO:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!

ALONSO:
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

ANTONIO:
What a blow was there given!

ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

ANTONIO:
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate.

ANTONIO:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.

ANTONIO:
I am more serious than my custom: you
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.

ANTONIO:
I'll teach you how to flow.

ANTONIO:
O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.

ANTONIO:
Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
And he that sleeps here swims.

ANTONIO:
O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?

ANTONIO:
Then, tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?

ANTONIO:
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.

ANTONIO:
A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?

ANTONIO:
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?

ANTONIO:
True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

ANTONIO:
Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.

ANTONIO:
Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.

ARIEL:
My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
For else his project dies--to keep them living.
While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:
Awake, awake!

ANTONIO:
Then let us both be sudden.

ALONSO:
Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

ALONSO:
I heard nothing.

ANTONIO:
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.

ALONSO:
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

ALONSO:
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son.

ALONSO:
Lead away.

ARIEL:
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.

CALIBAN:
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.

CALIBAN:
Do not torment me: Oh!

CALIBAN:
The spirit torments me; Oh!

CALIBAN:
Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.

CALIBAN:
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

CALIBAN:

CALIBAN:
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.

CALIBAN:
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

CALIBAN:
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

CALIBAN:
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

CALIBAN:
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

CALIBAN:
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

CALIBAN:
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

CALIBAN:

CALIBAN:
No more dams I'll make for fish
Nor fetch in firing
At requiring;
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
Has a new master: get a new man.
Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
hey-day, freedom!

FERDINAND:
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.

FERDINAND:
O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.

FERDINAND:
No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.

FERDINAND:
No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name?

FERDINAND:
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration! worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so fun soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!

FERDINAND:
I am in my condition
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service; there resides,
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log--man.

FERDINAND:
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Do love, prize, honour you.

FERDINAND:
Wherefore weep you?

FERDINAND:
My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.

FERDINAND:
Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

FERDINAND:
A thousand thousand!

CALIBAN:
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.

CALIBAN:
Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?

CALIBAN:
Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

CALIBAN:
I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

CALIBAN:
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

ARIEL:
Thou liest.

CALIBAN:
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.

CALIBAN:
I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
From me he got it. if thy greatness will
Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
But this thing dare not,--

CALIBAN:
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.

CALIBAN:
Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.

ARIEL:
Thou liest; thou canst not.

CALIBAN:
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.

ARIEL:
Thou liest.

CALIBAN:
Ha, ha, ha!

CALIBAN:
Beat him enough: after a little time
I'll beat him too.

CALIBAN:
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books, or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.

CALIBAN:
Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.

CALIBAN:
Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?

ARIEL:
This will I tell my master.

CALIBAN:
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?

CALIBAN:
That's not the tune.

CALIBAN:
Art thou afeard?

CALIBAN:
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

CALIBAN:
When Prospero is destroyed.

ALONSO:
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

ANTONIO:

ANTONIO:

ALONSO:
What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

ALONSO:
Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

ANTONIO:
I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
lie,
Though fools at home condemn 'em.

ALONSO:
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.

ALONSO:
Not I.

ALONSO:
I will stand to and feed,
Although my last: no matter, since I feel
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
Stand to and do as we.

ARIEL:
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.
You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
For that's my business to you--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Lingering perdition, worse than any death
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.

ALONSO:
O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
And with him there lie mudded.

ANTONIO:
I'll be thy second.

ADRIAN:
Follow, I pray you.

ARIEL:
What would my potent master? here I am.

ARIEL:
Presently?

ARIEL:
Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
Each one, tripping on his toe,
Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master? no?

ARIEL:
Well, I conceive.

CERES:
Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

CERES:
Tell me, heavenly bow,
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
I have forsworn.

CERES:
High'st queen of state,
Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.

CERES:
Earth's increase, foison plenty,
Barns and garners never empty,
Vines and clustering bunches growing,
Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you;
Ceres' blessing so is on you.

ARIEL:
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?

ARIEL:
Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
Lest I might anger thee.

ARIEL:
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
So fun of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
their ears,
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
O'erstunk their feet.

ARIEL:
I go, I go.

CALIBAN:
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

CALIBAN:
Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.

CALIBAN:
Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.

CALIBAN:
Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

CALIBAN:
The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
And do the murder first: if he awake,
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.

CALIBAN:
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villanous low.

ARIEL:
Silver I there it goes, Silver!

ARIEL:
Hark, they roar!

ARIEL:
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease.

ARIEL:
Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
They cannot budge till your release. The king,
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them, your affections
Would become tender.

ARIEL:
Mine would, sir, were I human.

ARIEL:
I'll fetch them, sir.

ARIEL:
I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat.

ALONSO:
Whether thou best he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
An if this be at all, a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?

ALONSO:
If thou be'st Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.

ALONSO:
Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Says it is past her cure.

ALONSO:
You the like loss!

ALONSO:
A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

ALONSO:
If this prove
A vision of the Island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose.

ALONSO:
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise, and say how thou camest here.

ALONSO:
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
And brought us thus together?

ALONSO:
I am hers:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!

ALONSO:
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

ALONSO:

Boatswain:
The best news is, that we have safely found
Our king and company; the next, our ship--
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
We first put out to sea.

ARIEL:

ALONSO:
These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

Boatswain:
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
Even in a dream, were we divided from them
And were brought moping hither.

ARIEL:

ALONSO:
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.

CALIBAN:
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.

ANTONIO:
Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

CALIBAN:
I shall be pinch'd to death.

ALONSO:
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

ALONSO:
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How camest thou in this pickle?

ALONSO:
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

CALIBAN:
Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
And worship this dull fool!

ALONSO:
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

ALONSO:
I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.

BEATRICE:
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
wars or no?

BEATRICE:
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

BEATRICE:
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
excellent stomach.

BEATRICE:
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?

BEATRICE:
It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.

BEATRICE:
Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.

BEATRICE:
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
next block.

BEATRICE:
No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
you, who is his companion? Is there no young
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?

BEATRICE:
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
thousand pound ere a' be cured.

BEATRICE:
Do, good friend.

BEATRICE:
No, not till a hot January.

DON PEDRO:
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost, and you encounter it.

DON PEDRO:
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
is your daughter.

BENEDICK:
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

DON PEDRO:
You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
honourable father.

BENEDICK:
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
like him as she is.

BEATRICE:
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
Benedick: nobody marks you.

BENEDICK:
What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?

BEATRICE:
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
in her presence.

BENEDICK:
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart; for, truly, I love none.

BEATRICE:
A dear happiness to women: they would else have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me.

BENEDICK:
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
scratched face.

BEATRICE:
Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
a face as yours were.

BENEDICK:
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.

BEATRICE:
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.

BENEDICK:
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
name; I have done.

BEATRICE:
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.

DON PEDRO:
That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month; and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.

DON JOHN:
I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
you.

DON PEDRO:
Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.

CLAUDIO:
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?

BENEDICK:
I noted her not; but I looked on her.

CLAUDIO:
Is she not a modest young lady?

BENEDICK:
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

CLAUDIO:
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

BENEDICK:
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
afford her, that were she other than she is, she
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
do not like her.

CLAUDIO:
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her.

BENEDICK:
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?

CLAUDIO:
Can the world buy such a jewel?

BENEDICK:
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
you, to go in the song?

CLAUDIO:
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
looked on.

BENEDICK:
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?

CLAUDIO:
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.

BENEDICK:
Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.

DON PEDRO:
What secret hath held you here, that you followed
not to Leonato's?

BENEDICK:
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.

DON PEDRO:
I charge thee on thy allegiance.

BENEDICK:
You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
man; I would have you think so; but, on my
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
short daughter.

CLAUDIO:
If this were so, so were it uttered.

BENEDICK:
Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
so.'

CLAUDIO:
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
should be otherwise.

DON PEDRO:
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.

CLAUDIO:
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
By my troth, I speak my thought.

CLAUDIO:
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

BENEDICK:
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.

CLAUDIO:
That I love her, I feel.

DON PEDRO:
That she is worthy, I know.

BENEDICK:
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.

DON PEDRO:
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
of beauty.

CLAUDIO:
And never could maintain his part but in the force
of his will.

BENEDICK:
That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.

DON PEDRO:
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.

BENEDICK:
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
blind Cupid.

DON PEDRO:
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
wilt prove a notable argument.

BENEDICK:
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
the shoulder, and called Adam.

DON PEDRO:
Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke.'

BENEDICK:
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'

CLAUDIO:
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.

DON PEDRO:
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.

BENEDICK:
I look for an earthquake too, then.

DON PEDRO:
Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.

BENEDICK:
I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage; and so I commit you--

CLAUDIO:
To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--

DON PEDRO:
The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.

BENEDICK:
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
you flout old ends any further, examine your
conscience: and so I leave you.

CLAUDIO:
My liege, your highness now may do me good.

DON PEDRO:
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

CLAUDIO:
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

DON PEDRO:
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
O, my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.

DON PEDRO:
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?

CLAUDIO:
How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

DON PEDRO:
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practise let us put it presently.

ANTONIO:
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.

ANTONIO:
As the event stamps them: but they have a good
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance: and if he found her
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
top and instantly break with you of it.

ANTONIO:
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
question him yourself.

CONRADE:
What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
of measure sad?

DON JOHN:
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
therefore the sadness is without limit.

CONRADE:
You should hear reason.

DON JOHN:
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?

CONRADE:
If not a present remedy, at least a patient
sufferance.

DON JOHN:
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
claw no man in his humour.

CONRADE:
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
till you may do it without controlment. You have of
late stood out against your brother, and he hath
ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest.

DON JOHN:
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me.

CONRADE:
Can you make no use of your discontent?

DON JOHN:
I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Who comes here?
What news, Borachio?

BORACHIO:
I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.

DON JOHN:
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?

BORACHIO:
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

DON JOHN:
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?

BORACHIO:
Even he.

DON JOHN:
A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
he?

BORACHIO:
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.

DON JOHN:
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?

BORACHIO:
Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.

DON JOHN:
Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?

CONRADE:
To the death, my lord.

DON JOHN:
Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?

BORACHIO:
We'll wait upon your lordship.

ANTONIO:
I saw him not.

BEATRICE:
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.

BEATRICE:
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
like an image and says nothing, and the other too
like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.

BEATRICE:
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
in the world, if a' could get her good-will.

ANTONIO:
In faith, she's too curst.

BEATRICE:
Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.

BEATRICE:
Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.

BEATRICE:
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
apes into hell.

BEATRICE:
No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
there live we as merry as the day is long.

ANTONIO:

BEATRICE:
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
me.'

BEATRICE:
Not till God make men of some other metal than
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.

BEATRICE:
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
important, tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

BEATRICE:
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.

DON PEDRO:
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

DON PEDRO:
With me in your company?

DON PEDRO:
And when please you to say so?

DON PEDRO:
My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.

DON PEDRO:
Speak low, if you speak love.

BALTHASAR:
Well, I would you did like me.

BALTHASAR:
Which is one?

BALTHASAR:
I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.

BALTHASAR:
Amen.

BALTHASAR:
No more words: the clerk is answered.

ANTONIO:
At a word, I am not.

ANTONIO:
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.

ANTONIO:
At a word, I am not.

BEATRICE:
Will you not tell me who told you so?

BENEDICK:
No, you shall pardon me.

BEATRICE:
Nor will you not tell me who you are?

BENEDICK:
Not now.

BEATRICE:
That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
Signior Benedick that said so.

BENEDICK:
What's he?

BEATRICE:
I am sure you know him well enough.

BENEDICK:
Not I, believe me.

BEATRICE:
Did he never make you laugh?

BENEDICK:
I pray you, what is he?

BEATRICE:
Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
none but libertines delight in him; and the
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.

BENEDICK:
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.

BEATRICE:
Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
supper that night.
We must follow the leaders.

BENEDICK:
In every good thing.

BEATRICE:
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
the next turning.

DON JOHN:
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.

BORACHIO:
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.

DON JOHN:
Are not you Signior Benedick?

CLAUDIO:
You know me well; I am he.

DON JOHN:
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
do the part of an honest man in it.

CLAUDIO:
How know you he loves her?

DON JOHN:
I heard him swear his affection.

BORACHIO:
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.

DON JOHN:
Come, let us to the banquet.

CLAUDIO:
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!

BENEDICK:
Count Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Yea, the same.

BENEDICK:
Come, will you go with me?

CLAUDIO:
Whither?

BENEDICK:
Even to the next willow, about your own business,
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.

CLAUDIO:
I wish him joy of her.

BENEDICK:
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
have served you thus?

CLAUDIO:
I pray you, leave me.

BENEDICK:
Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.

CLAUDIO:
If it will not be, I'll leave you.

BENEDICK:
Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

DON PEDRO:
Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?

BENEDICK:
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.

DON PEDRO:
To be whipped! What's his fault?

BENEDICK:
The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
companion, and he steals it.

DON PEDRO:
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.

BENEDICK:
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
and the garland too; for the garland he might have
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.

DON PEDRO:
I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
the owner.

BENEDICK:
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
you say honestly.

DON PEDRO:
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you.

BENEDICK:
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
and perturbation follows her.

DON PEDRO:
Look, here she comes.

BENEDICK:
Will your grace command me any service to the
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
rather than hold three words' conference with this
harpy. You have no employment for me?

DON PEDRO:
None, but to desire your good company.

BENEDICK:
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
endure my Lady Tongue.

DON PEDRO:
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
Signior Benedick.

BEATRICE:
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

DON PEDRO:
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.

BEATRICE:
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.

DON PEDRO:
Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?

CLAUDIO:
Not sad, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
How then? sick?

CLAUDIO:
Neither, my lord.

BEATRICE:
The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
something of that jealous complexion.

DON PEDRO:
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained: name the day of
marriage, and God give thee joy!

BEATRICE:
Speak, count, 'tis your cue.

CLAUDIO:
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange.

BEATRICE:
Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.

DON PEDRO:
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

BEATRICE:
Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart.

CLAUDIO:
And so she doth, cousin.

BEATRICE:
Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!

DON PEDRO:
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

BEATRICE:
I would rather have one of your father's getting.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.

DON PEDRO:
Will you have me, lady?

BEATRICE:
No, my lord, unless I might have another for
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

DON PEDRO:
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
a merry hour.

BEATRICE:
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Cousins, God give you joy!

BEATRICE:
I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.

DON PEDRO:
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

DON PEDRO:
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

DON PEDRO:
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.

DON PEDRO:
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

CLAUDIO:
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
have all his rites.

DON PEDRO:
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other. I would fain have
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction.

CLAUDIO:
And I, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
And you too, gentle Hero?

DON PEDRO:
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
and I will tell you my drift.

DON JOHN:
It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
daughter of Leonato.

BORACHIO:
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

DON JOHN:
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?

BORACHIO:
Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
dishonesty shall appear in me.

DON JOHN:
Show me briefly how.

BORACHIO:
I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
gentlewoman to Hero.

DON JOHN:
I remember.

BORACHIO:
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

DON JOHN:
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

BORACHIO:
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.

DON JOHN:
What proof shall I make of that?

BORACHIO:
Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
other issue?

DON JOHN:
Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.

BORACHIO:
Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
offer them instances; which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.

DON JOHN:
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
thy fee is a thousand ducats.

BORACHIO:
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
shall not shame me.

DON JOHN:
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

BENEDICK:
Boy!

Boy:
Signior?

BENEDICK:
In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
to me in the orchard.

Boy:
I am here already, sir.

BENEDICK:
I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others, become the argument
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.

DON PEDRO:
Come, shall we hear this music?

CLAUDIO:
Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!

DON PEDRO:
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

CLAUDIO:
O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.

DON PEDRO:
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

BALTHASAR:
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once.

DON PEDRO:
It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

BALTHASAR:
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
Yet will he swear he loves.

DON PEDRO:
Now, pray thee, come;
Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
Do it in notes.

BALTHASAR:
Note this before my notes;
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.

DON PEDRO:
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.

BENEDICK:
Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
all's done.

BALTHASAR:
Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
Men were deceivers ever,
One foot in sea and one on shore,
To one thing constant never:
Then sigh not so, but let them go,
And be you blithe and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny, nonny.
Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
Of dumps so dull and heavy;
The fraud of men was ever so,
Since summer first was leafy:
Then sigh not so, &c.

DON PEDRO:
By my troth, a good song.

BALTHASAR:
And an ill singer, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.

BENEDICK:
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
night-raven, come what plague could have come after
it.

DON PEDRO:
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.

BALTHASAR:
The best I can, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
Do so: farewell.
Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
Signior Benedick?

CLAUDIO:
O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
never think that lady would have loved any man.

BENEDICK:
Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?

DON PEDRO:
May be she doth but counterfeit.

CLAUDIO:
Faith, like enough.

DON PEDRO:
Why, what effects of passion shows she?

CLAUDIO:
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.

CLAUDIO:
She did, indeed.

DON PEDRO:
How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
assaults of affection.

BENEDICK:
I should think this a gull, but that the
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
sure, hide himself in such reverence.

CLAUDIO:
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.

DON PEDRO:
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

CLAUDIO:
'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
with scorn, write to him that I love him?'

CLAUDIO:
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
pretty jest your daughter told us of.

CLAUDIO:
That.

CLAUDIO:
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'

DON PEDRO:
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
other, if she will not discover it.

CLAUDIO:
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
torment the poor lady worse.

DON PEDRO:
An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
she is virtuous.

CLAUDIO:
And she is exceeding wise.

DON PEDRO:
In every thing but in loving Benedick.

DON PEDRO:
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
have daffed all other respects and made her half
myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
what a' will say.

CLAUDIO:
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
accustomed crossness.

DON PEDRO:
She doth well: if she should make tender of her
love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.

CLAUDIO:
He is a very proper man.

DON PEDRO:
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

CLAUDIO:
Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.

DON PEDRO:
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.

CLAUDIO:
And I take him to be valiant.

DON PEDRO:
As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
them with a most Christian-like fear.

DON PEDRO:
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?

CLAUDIO:
Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
good counsel.

DON PEDRO:
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

CLAUDIO:
If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
trust my expectation.

DON PEDRO:
Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
scene that I would see, which will be merely a
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

BENEDICK:

BEATRICE:
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.

BENEDICK:
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

BEATRICE:
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
not have come.

BENEDICK:
You take pleasure then in the message?

BEATRICE:
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
signior: fare you well.

BENEDICK:
Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

BEATRICE:

DON PEDRO:
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
then go I toward Arragon.

CLAUDIO:
I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
vouchsafe me.

DON PEDRO:
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
tongue speaks.

BENEDICK:
Gallants, I am not as I have been.

CLAUDIO:
I hope he be in love.

DON PEDRO:
Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
he wants money.

BENEDICK:
I have the toothache.

DON PEDRO:
Draw it.

BENEDICK:
Hang it!

CLAUDIO:
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

DON PEDRO:
What! sigh for the toothache?

BENEDICK:
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
it.

CLAUDIO:
Yet say I, he is in love.

DON PEDRO:
There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.

CLAUDIO:
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
mornings; what should that bode?

DON PEDRO:
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

CLAUDIO:
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
stuffed tennis-balls.

DON PEDRO:
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
out by that?

CLAUDIO:
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.

DON PEDRO:
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

CLAUDIO:
And when was he wont to wash his face?

DON PEDRO:
Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
what they say of him.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
a lute-string and now governed by stops.

DON PEDRO:
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
conclude he is in love.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, but I know who loves him.

DON PEDRO:
That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.

CLAUDIO:
Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
all, dies for him.

DON PEDRO:
She shall be buried with her face upwards.

BENEDICK:
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
hobby-horses must not hear.

DON PEDRO:
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

CLAUDIO:
'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
bears will not bite one another when they meet.

DON JOHN:
My lord and brother, God save you!

DON PEDRO:
Good den, brother.

DON JOHN:
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.

DON PEDRO:
In private?

DON JOHN:
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
what I would speak of concerns him.

DON PEDRO:
What's the matter?

DON JOHN:

DON PEDRO:
You know he does.

DON JOHN:
I know not that, when he knows what I know.

CLAUDIO:
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.

DON JOHN:
You may think I love you not: let that appear
hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
labour ill bestowed.

DON PEDRO:
Why, what's the matter?

DON JOHN:
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
the lady is disloyal.

CLAUDIO:
Who, Hero?

DON PEDRO:
Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:

CLAUDIO:
Disloyal?

DON JOHN:
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
could say she were worse: think you of a worse
title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
see her chamber-window entered, even the night
before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
to change your mind.

CLAUDIO:
May this be so?

DON PEDRO:
I will not think it.

DON JOHN:
If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
more, proceed accordingly.

CLAUDIO:
If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
wed, there will I shame her.

DON PEDRO:
And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
with thee to disgrace her.

DON JOHN:
I will disparage her no farther till you are my
witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
let the issue show itself.

DON PEDRO:
O day untowardly turned!

CLAUDIO:
O mischief strangely thwarting!

DON JOHN:
O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
you have seen the sequel.

DOGBERRY:
Are you good men and true?

DOGBERRY:
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
they should have any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the prince's watch.

DOGBERRY:
First, who think you the most desertless man to be
constable?

DOGBERRY:
Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.

DOGBERRY:
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity. You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.

DOGBERRY:
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank God you are rid of a knave.

DOGBERRY:
True, and they are to meddle with none but the
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.

DOGBERRY:
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

DOGBERRY:
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
they make you not then the better answer, you may
say they are not the men you took them for.

DOGBERRY:
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your honesty.

DOGBERRY:
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.

DOGBERRY:
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
a man who hath any honesty in him.

DOGBERRY:
Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.

DOGBERRY:
This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
prince in the night, you may stay him.

DOGBERRY:
Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.

DOGBERRY:
Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
Come, neighbour.

DOGBERRY:
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

BORACHIO:
What Conrade!

BORACHIO:
Conrade, I say!

CONRADE:
Here, man; I am at thy elbow.

BORACHIO:
Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
scab follow.

CONRADE:
I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
with thy tale.

BORACHIO:
Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
utter all to thee.

BORACHIO:
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.

CONRADE:
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?

BORACHIO:
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
price they will.

CONRADE:
I wonder at it.

BORACHIO:
That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
nothing to a man.

CONRADE:
Yes, it is apparel.

BORACHIO:
I mean, the fashion.

CONRADE:
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

BORACHIO:
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
is?

BORACHIO:
Didst thou not hear somebody?

CONRADE:
No; 'twas the vane on the house.

BORACHIO:
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?

CONRADE:
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?

BORACHIO:
Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.

CONRADE:
And thought they Margaret was Hero?

BORACHIO:
Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
at the temple, and there, before the whole
congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
and send her home again without a husband.

CONRADE:
Masters, masters,--

CONRADE:
Masters,--

BORACHIO:
We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
up of these men's bills.

CONRADE:
A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.

BEATRICE:
Good morrow, sweet Hero.

BEATRICE:
I am out of all other tune, methinks.

BEATRICE:
Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
lack no barns.

BEATRICE:
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!

BEATRICE:
For the letter that begins them all, H.

BEATRICE:
What means the fool, trow?

BEATRICE:
I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.

BEATRICE:
O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
professed apprehension?

BEATRICE:
It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
cap. By my troth, I am sick.

BEATRICE:
Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
this Benedictus.

BEATRICE:
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?

DOGBERRY:
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
that decerns you nearly.

DOGBERRY:
Marry, this it is, sir.

DOGBERRY:
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.

DOGBERRY:
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.

DOGBERRY:
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

DOGBERRY:
Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
am glad to hear it.

DOGBERRY:
A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
are not alike; alas, good neighbour!

DOGBERRY:
Gifts that God gives.

DOGBERRY:
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
have them this morning examined before your worship.

DOGBERRY:
It shall be suffigance.

DOGBERRY:
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
are now to examination these men.

DOGBERRY:
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
get the learned writer to set down our
excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

CLAUDIO:
No.

CLAUDIO:
Know you any, Hero?

CLAUDIO:
O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
do, not knowing what they do!

BENEDICK:
How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
laughing, as, ah, ha, he!

CLAUDIO:
Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid, your daughter?

CLAUDIO:
And what have I to give you back, whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

DON PEDRO:
Nothing, unless you render her again.

CLAUDIO:
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
There, Leonato, take her back again:
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
O, what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
All you that see her, that she were a maid,
By these exterior shows? But she is none:
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

CLAUDIO:
Not to be married,
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

CLAUDIO:
I know what you would say: if I have known her,
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
No, Leonato,
I never tempted her with word too large;
But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
Bashful sincerity and comely love.

CLAUDIO:
Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
But you are more intemperate in your blood
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
That rage in savage sensuality.

DON PEDRO:
What should I speak?
I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
To link my dear friend to a common stale.

DON JOHN:
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

BENEDICK:
This looks not like a nuptial.

CLAUDIO:
Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?

CLAUDIO:
Let me but move one question to your daughter;
And, by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

CLAUDIO:
To make you answer truly to your name.

CLAUDIO:
Marry, that can Hero;
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

DON PEDRO:
Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
Myself, my brother and this grieved count
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret.

DON JOHN:
Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
Not to be spoke of;
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

CLAUDIO:
O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
If half thy outward graces had been placed
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
And never shall it more be gracious.

BEATRICE:
Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?

DON JOHN:
Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
Smother her spirits up.

BENEDICK:
How doth the lady?

BEATRICE:
Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!

BEATRICE:
How now, cousin Hero!

BENEDICK:
Sir, sir, be patient.
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
I know not what to say.

BEATRICE:
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

BENEDICK:
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

BEATRICE:
No, truly not; although, until last night,
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

BENEDICK:
Two of them have the very bent of honour;
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.

BENEDICK:
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body.

BENEDICK:
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

BEATRICE:
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

BENEDICK:
I will not desire that.

BEATRICE:
You have no reason; I do it freely.

BENEDICK:
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

BEATRICE:
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!

BENEDICK:
Is there any way to show such friendship?

BEATRICE:
A very even way, but no such friend.

BENEDICK:
May a man do it?

BEATRICE:
It is a man's office, but not yours.

BENEDICK:
I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
not that strange?

BEATRICE:
As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.

BENEDICK:
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

BEATRICE:
Do not swear, and eat it.

BENEDICK:
I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
him eat it that says I love not you.

BEATRICE:
Will you not eat your word?

BENEDICK:
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
I love thee.

BEATRICE:
Why, then, God forgive me!

BENEDICK:
What offence, sweet Beatrice?

BEATRICE:
You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
protest I loved you.

BENEDICK:
And do it with all thy heart.

BEATRICE:
I love you with so much of my heart that none is
left to protest.

BENEDICK:
Come, bid me do any thing for thee.

BEATRICE:
Kill Claudio.

BENEDICK:
Ha! not for the wide world.

BEATRICE:
You kill me to deny it. Farewell.

BENEDICK:
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

BEATRICE:
I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
you: nay, I pray you, let me go.

BENEDICK:
Beatrice,--

BEATRICE:
In faith, I will go.

BENEDICK:
We'll be friends first.

BEATRICE:
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.

BENEDICK:
Is Claudio thine enemy?

BEATRICE:
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
come to take hands; and then, with public
accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
in the market-place.

BENEDICK:
Hear me, Beatrice,--

BEATRICE:
Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!

BENEDICK:
Nay, but, Beatrice,--

BEATRICE:
Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.

BENEDICK:
Beat--

BEATRICE:
Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

BENEDICK:
Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.

BEATRICE:
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.

BENEDICK:
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

BEATRICE:
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.

BENEDICK:
Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.

DOGBERRY:
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

DOGBERRY:
Marry, that am I and my partner.

DOGBERRY:
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
name, friend?

BORACHIO:
Borachio.

DOGBERRY:
Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?

CONRADE:
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.

DOGBERRY:
Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
you serve God?

CONRADE:
Yea, sir, we hope.

DOGBERRY:
Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
write God first; for God defend but God should go
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves; and it
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
you for yourselves?

CONRADE:
Marry, sir, we say we are none.

DOGBERRY:
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
you are false knaves.

BORACHIO:
Sir, I say to you we are none.

DOGBERRY:
Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?

DOGBERRY:
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
name, accuse these men.

DOGBERRY:
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.

BORACHIO:
Master constable,--

DOGBERRY:
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
I promise thee.

DOGBERRY:
Flat burglary as ever was committed.

DOGBERRY:
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
redemption for this.

DOGBERRY:
Come, let them be opinioned.

CONRADE:
Off, coxcomb!

DOGBERRY:
God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
Thou naughty varlet!

CONRADE:
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.

DOGBERRY:
Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
I had been writ down an ass!

ANTONIO:
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself.

ANTONIO:
Therein do men from children nothing differ.

ANTONIO:
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
Make those that do offend you suffer too.

ANTONIO:
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.

DON PEDRO:
Good den, good den.

CLAUDIO:
Good day to both of you.

DON PEDRO:
We have some haste, Leonato.

DON PEDRO:
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

ANTONIO:
If he could right himself with quarreling,
Some of us would lie low.

CLAUDIO:
Who wrongs him?

CLAUDIO:
Marry, beshrew my hand,
If it should give your age such cause of fear:
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

CLAUDIO:
My villany?

DON PEDRO:
You say not right, old man.

CLAUDIO:
Away! I will not have to do with you.

ANTONIO:
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

ANTONIO:
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!

ANTONIO:
Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
And this is all.

ANTONIO:
Come, 'tis no matter:
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.

DON PEDRO:
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof.

DON PEDRO:
I will not hear you.

ANTONIO:
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.

DON PEDRO:
See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.

CLAUDIO:
Now, signior, what news?

BENEDICK:
Good day, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
almost a fray.

CLAUDIO:
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
with two old men without teeth.

DON PEDRO:
Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.

BENEDICK:
In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
to seek you both.

CLAUDIO:
We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?

BENEDICK:
It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?

DON PEDRO:
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

CLAUDIO:
Never any did so, though very many have been beside
their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.

DON PEDRO:
As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
sick, or angry?

CLAUDIO:
What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.

BENEDICK:
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
broke cross.

DON PEDRO:
By this light, he changes more and more: I think
he be angry indeed.

CLAUDIO:
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.

BENEDICK:
Shall I speak a word in your ear?

CLAUDIO:
God bless me from a challenge!

BENEDICK:

CLAUDIO:
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.

DON PEDRO:
What, a feast, a feast?

CLAUDIO:
I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
a woodcock too?

BENEDICK:
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

DON PEDRO:
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
wast the properest man in Italy.

CLAUDIO:
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
not.

DON PEDRO:
Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
the old man's daughter told us all.

CLAUDIO:
All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
hid in the garden.

DON PEDRO:
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
the sensible Benedick's head?

CLAUDIO:
Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
married man'?

BENEDICK:
Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
then, peace be with him.

DON PEDRO:
He is in earnest.

CLAUDIO:
In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
the love of Beatrice.

DON PEDRO:
And hath challenged thee.

CLAUDIO:
Most sincerely.

DON PEDRO:
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!

CLAUDIO:
He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
doctor to such a man.

DON PEDRO:
But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?

DOGBERRY:
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.

DON PEDRO:
How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
one!

CLAUDIO:
Hearken after their offence, my lord.

DON PEDRO:
Officers, what offence have these men done?

DOGBERRY:
Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

DON PEDRO:
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
to their charge.

CLAUDIO:
Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
my troth, there's one meaning well suited.

DON PEDRO:
Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
bound to your answer? this learned constable is
too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?

BORACHIO:
Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
nothing but the reward of a villain.

DON PEDRO:
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

CLAUDIO:
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.

DON PEDRO:
But did my brother set thee on to this?

BORACHIO:
Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.

DON PEDRO:
He is composed and framed of treachery:
And fled he is upon this villany.

CLAUDIO:
Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.

DOGBERRY:
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
and place shall serve, that I am an ass.

BORACHIO:
If you would know your wronger, look on me.

BORACHIO:
Yea, even I alone.

CLAUDIO:
I know not how to pray your patience;
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
Impose me to what penance your invention
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
But in mistaking.

DON PEDRO:
By my soul, nor I:
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
I would bend under any heavy weight
That he'll enjoin me to.

CLAUDIO:
O noble sir,
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
I do embrace your offer; and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio.

BORACHIO:
No, by my soul, she was not,
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
But always hath been just and virtuous
In any thing that I do know by her.

DOGBERRY:
Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.

DOGBERRY:
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
reverend youth; and I praise God for you.

DOGBERRY:
God save the foundation!

DOGBERRY:
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
your worship well; God restore you to health! I
humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

ANTONIO:
Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.

DON PEDRO:
We will not fail.

CLAUDIO:
To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

BENEDICK:
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.

BENEDICK:
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
deservest it.

BENEDICK:
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.

BENEDICK:
A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
thee the bucklers.

BENEDICK:
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

BENEDICK:
And therefore will come.
The god of love,
That sits above,
And knows me, and knows me,
How pitiful I deserve,--
I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?

BEATRICE:
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

BENEDICK:
O, stay but till then!

BEATRICE:
'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.

BENEDICK:
Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.

BEATRICE:
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
will depart unkissed.

BENEDICK:
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?

BEATRICE:
For them all together; which maintained so politic
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
good parts did you first suffer love for me?

BENEDICK:
Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
indeed, for I love thee against my will.

BEATRICE:
In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.

BENEDICK:
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

BEATRICE:
It appears not in this confession: there's not one
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.

BENEDICK:
An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
widow weeps.

BEATRICE:
And how long is that, think you?

BENEDICK:
Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?

BEATRICE:
Very ill.

BENEDICK:
And how do you?

BEATRICE:
Very ill too.

BENEDICK:
Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
you too, for here comes one in haste.

BEATRICE:
Will you go hear this news, signior?

BENEDICK:
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
thee to thy uncle's.

CLAUDIO:
Is this the monument of Leonato?

CLAUDIO:

CLAUDIO:
Now, unto thy bones good night!
Yearly will I do this rite.

DON PEDRO:
Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.

CLAUDIO:
Good morrow, masters: each his several way.

DON PEDRO:
Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
And then to Leonato's we will go.

CLAUDIO:
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

ANTONIO:
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

BENEDICK:
And so am I, being else by faith enforced
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

ANTONIO:
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.

BENEDICK:
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

BENEDICK:
To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.

BENEDICK:
And I do with an eye of love requite her.

BENEDICK:
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
But, for my will, my will is your good will
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
In the state of honourable marriage:
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

DON PEDRO:
Good morrow to this fair assembly.

CLAUDIO:
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

DON PEDRO:
Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
That you have such a February face,
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

CLAUDIO:
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
When he would play the noble beast in love.

BENEDICK:
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

CLAUDIO:
For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

ANTONIO:
This same is she, and I do give you her.

CLAUDIO:
Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.

CLAUDIO:
Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
I am your husband, if you like of me.

CLAUDIO:
Another Hero!

DON PEDRO:
The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

BENEDICK:
Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?

BEATRICE:

BENEDICK:
Do not you love me?

BEATRICE:
Why, no; no more than reason.

BENEDICK:
Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
Have been deceived; they swore you did.

BEATRICE:
Do not you love me?

BENEDICK:
Troth, no; no more than reason.

BEATRICE:
Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.

BENEDICK:
They swore that you were almost sick for me.

BEATRICE:
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

BENEDICK:
'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?

BEATRICE:
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

CLAUDIO:
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
For here's a paper written in his hand,
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
Fashion'd to Beatrice.

BENEDICK:
A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
thee for pity.

BEATRICE:
I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
for I was told you were in a consumption.

BENEDICK:
Peace! I will stop your mouth.

DON PEDRO:
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?

BENEDICK:
I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:
if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
purpose that the world can say against it; and
therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.

CLAUDIO:
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
exceedingly narrowly to thee.

BENEDICK:
Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives' heels.

BENEDICK:
First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.

BENEDICK:
Think not on him till to-morrow:
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
Strike up, pipers.

EDMUND:
No, my lord.

EDMUND:
My services to your lordship.

EDMUND:
Sir, I shall study deserving.

CORDELIA:

CORDELIA:

CORDELIA:
Nothing, my lord.

CORDELIA:
Nothing.

CORDELIA:
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.

CORDELIA:
Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
Return those duties back as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.

CORDELIA:
Ay, good my lord.

CORDELIA:
So young, my lord, and true.

ALBANY:
Dear sir, forbear.

BURGUNDY:
Most royal majesty,
I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
Nor will you tender less.

BURGUNDY:
I know no answer.

BURGUNDY:
Pardon me, royal sir;
Election makes not up on such conditions.

CORDELIA:
I yet beseech your majesty,--
If for I want that glib and oily art,
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.

BURGUNDY:
Royal Lear,
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.

BURGUNDY:
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.

CORDELIA:
Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
I shall not be his wife.

CORDELIA:
The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So, farewell to you both.

CORDELIA:
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper!

EDMUND:
Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

EDMUND:
So please your lordship, none.

EDMUND:
I know no news, my lord.

EDMUND:
Nothing, my lord.

EDMUND:
I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
fit for your o'er-looking.

EDMUND:
I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.

EDMUND:
I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.

EDMUND:
It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
casement of my closet.

EDMUND:
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
fain think it were not.

EDMUND:
It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
not in the contents.

EDMUND:
Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
and fathers declining, the father should be as
ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

EDMUND:
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
course; where, if you violently proceed against
him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour, and to no further
pretence of danger.

EDMUND:
If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
that without any further delay than this very evening.

EDMUND:
Nor is not, sure.

EDMUND:
I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.

EDMUND:
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
if we were villains by necessity; fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star! My
father compounded with my mother under the
dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
major; so that it follows, I am rough and
lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

EDGAR:
How now, brother Edmund! what serious
contemplation are you in?

EDMUND:
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
this other day, what should follow these eclipses.

EDGAR:
Do you busy yourself about that?

EDMUND:
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles; needless
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

EDGAR:
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?

EDMUND:
Come, come; when saw you my father last?

EDGAR:
Why, the night gone by.

EDMUND:
Spake you with him?

EDGAR:
Ay, two hours together.

EDMUND:
Parted you in good terms? Found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance?

EDGAR:
None at all.

EDMUND:
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
in him, that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay.

EDGAR:
Some villain hath done me wrong.

EDMUND:
That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
if you do stir abroad, go armed.

EDGAR:
Armed, brother!

EDMUND:
Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
towards you: I have told you what I have seen
and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
and horror of it: pray you, away.

EDGAR:
Shall I hear from you anon?

EDMUND:
I do serve you in this business.
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
My practises ride easy! I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

ALBANY:
Pray, sir, be patient.

ALBANY:
My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Of what hath moved you.

ALBANY:
Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

ALBANY:
What's the matter, sir?

ALBANY:
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
To the great love I bear you,--

ALBANY:
Well, you may fear too far.

ALBANY:
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

ALBANY:
Well, well; the event.

EDMUND:
Save thee, Curan.

CURAN:
And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
his duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND:
How comes that?

CURAN:
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
ear-kissing arguments?

EDMUND:
Not I pray you, what are they?

CURAN:
Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND:
Not a word.

CURAN:
You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

EDMUND:
The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
And Regan with him: have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.

EDGAR:
I am sure on't, not a word.

EDMUND:
I hear my father coming: pardon me:
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
Stop, stop! No help?

EDMUND:
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress,--

EDMUND:
Look, sir, I bleed.

EDMUND:
Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--

EDMUND:
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him, the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword, he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

EDMUND:
When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'

CORNWALL:
How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

EDMUND:
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

CORNWALL:
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A child-like office.

EDMUND:
'Twas my duty, sir.

CORNWALL:
Is he pursued?

CORNWALL:
If he be taken, he shall never more
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.

EDMUND:
I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

CORNWALL:
You know not why we came to visit you,--

EDMUND:
How now! What's the matter?

CORNWALL:
Keep peace, upon your lives:
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?

CORNWALL:
What is your difference? speak.

CORNWALL:
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

CORNWALL:
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

CORNWALL:
Peace, sirrah!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?

CORNWALL:
Why art thou angry?

CORNWALL:
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

CORNWALL:
Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?

CORNWALL:
No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.

CORNWALL:
This is some fellow,
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly ducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely.

CORNWALL:
What mean'st by this?

CORNWALL:
What was the offence you gave him?

CORNWALL:
Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
We'll teach you--

CORNWALL:
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
There shall he sit till noon.

CORNWALL:
This is a fellow of the self-same colour
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!

CORNWALL:
I'll answer that.

EDGAR:
I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
I will preserve myself: and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

CORNWALL:
Hail to your grace!

CORNWALL:
Fie, sir, fie!

CORNWALL:
What trumpet's that?

CORNWALL:
What means your grace?

CORNWALL:
I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
Deserved much less advancement.

CORNWALL:
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

CORNWALL:
Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.

CORNWALL:
Whither is he going?

CORNWALL:
'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

CORNWALL:
Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.

EDMUND:
Most savage and unnatural!

EDMUND:
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
Instantly know; and of that letter too:
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
That which my father loses; no less than all:
The younger rises when the old doth fall.

EDGAR:

EDGAR:
Away! the foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

EDGAR:
Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.

EDGAR:
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!

EDGAR:
Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
array. Tom's a-cold.

EDGAR:
A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.

EDGAR:
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
poor creature of earth.
S. Withold footed thrice the old;
He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
Bid her alight,
And her troth plight,
And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

EDGAR:
Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
But mice and rats, and such small deer,
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

EDGAR:
The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

EDGAR:
Poor Tom's a-cold.

EDGAR:
How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.

EDGAR:
Tom's a-cold.

EDGAR:
Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
I smell the blood of a British man.

CORNWALL:
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

EDMUND:
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
of.

CORNWALL:
I now perceive, it was not altogether your
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
badness in himself.

EDMUND:
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
or not I the detector!

CORNWALL:
o with me to the duchess.

EDMUND:
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
mighty business in hand.

CORNWALL:
True or false, it hath made thee earl of
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
may be ready for our apprehension.

EDMUND:

CORNWALL:
I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love.

EDGAR:
Frateretto calls me; and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

EDGAR:
The foul fiend bites my back.

EDGAR:
Look, where he stands and glares!
Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--

EDGAR:
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
food for thee.

EDGAR:
Let us deal justly.
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
Thy sheep be in the corn;
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
Thy sheep shall take no harm.
Pur! the cat is gray.

EDGAR:
Bless thy five wits!

EDGAR:

EDGAR:
Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
Be thy mouth or black or white,
Tooth that poisons if it bite;
Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
Tom will make them weep and wail:
For, with throwing thus my head,
Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

EDGAR:
When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
Lurk, lurk.

CORNWALL:
Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
out the villain Gloucester.

CORNWALL:
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
lord of Gloucester.
How now! where's the king?

CORNWALL:
Get horses for your mistress.

CORNWALL:
Edmund, farewell.
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
Though well we may not pass upon his life
Without the form of justice, yet our power
Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?

CORNWALL:
Bind fast his corky arms.

CORNWALL:
Bind him, I say.

CORNWALL:
To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--

CORNWALL:
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

CORNWALL:
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?

CORNWALL:
Cunning.

CORNWALL:
Where hast thou sent the king?

CORNWALL:
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

CORNWALL:
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

CORNWALL:
If you see vengeance,--

CORNWALL:
My villain!

CORNWALL:
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
Where is thy lustre now?

CORNWALL:
I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

EDGAR:
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
Lie would not yield to age.

EDGAR:

EDGAR:

EDGAR:

EDGAR:
Poor Tom's a-cold.
I cannot daub it further.

EDGAR:

EDGAR:
Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

EDGAR:
Ay, master.

EDGAR:
Give me thy arm:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

EDMUND:
Yours in the ranks of death.

ALBANY:
O Goneril!
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
That nature, which contemns its origin,
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap, perforce must wither
And come to deadly use.

ALBANY:
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
A father, and a gracious aged man,
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
It will come,
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
Like monsters of the deep.

ALBANY:
See thyself, devil!
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman.

ALBANY:
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
A woman's shape doth shield thee.

ALBANY:
What news?

ALBANY:
Gloucester's eye!

ALBANY:
This shows you are above,
You justicers, that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
Lost he his other eye?

ALBANY:
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

ALBANY:
He is not here.

ALBANY:
Knows he the wickedness?

ALBANY:
Gloucester, I live
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
Tell me what more thou know'st.

CORDELIA:
Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.
What can man's wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Doctor:
There is means, madam:
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
Are many simples operative, whose power
Will close the eye of anguish.

CORDELIA:
All blest secrets,
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.

CORDELIA:
'Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father,
It is thy business that I go about;
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
Soon may I hear and see him!

EDGAR:
You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

EDGAR:
Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?

EDGAR:
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.

EDGAR:
You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
But in my garments.

EDGAR:
Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.

EDGAR:
Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.

EDGAR:
Now fare you well, good sir.

EDGAR:
Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.

EDGAR:
Gone, sir: farewell.
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life, when life itself
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
What are you, sir?

EDGAR:
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating,
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

EDGAR:
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

EDGAR:
Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

EDGAR:
This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
Which parted from you?

EDGAR:
As I stood here below, methought his eyes
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

EDGAR:
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
His master thus.

EDGAR:
O thou side-piercing sight!

EDGAR:
Sweet marjoram.

EDGAR:
I would not take this from report; it is,
And my heart breaks at it.

EDGAR:
O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!

EDGAR:
Hail, gentle sir.

EDGAR:
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

EDGAR:
But, by your favour,
How near's the other army?

EDGAR:
I thank you, sir: that's all.

EDGAR:
I thank you, sir.

EDGAR:
Well pray you, father.

EDGAR:
A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
I'll lead you to some biding.

EDGAR:
Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.

EDGAR:
Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.

EDGAR:
Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
your foins.

EDGAR:
I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire.

EDGAR:
Sit you down, father; rest you
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
Their papers, is more lawful.
'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
the place for your labour.
'Your--wife, so I would say--
'Affectionate servant,
'GONERIL.'
O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell.

EDGAR:
Give me your hand:
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

CORDELIA:
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.

CORDELIA:
Be better suited:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
I prithee, put them off.

CORDELIA:
Then be't so, my good lord.
How does the king?

Doctor:
Madam, sleeps still.

CORDELIA:
O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
Of this child-changed father!

Doctor:
So please your majesty
That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.

CORDELIA:
Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

Doctor:
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
I doubt not of his temperance.

CORDELIA:
Very well.

Doctor:
Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!

CORDELIA:
O my dear father! Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!

CORDELIA:
Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

Doctor:
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

CORDELIA:
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?

CORDELIA:
Sir, do you know me?

CORDELIA:
Still, still, far wide!

Doctor:
He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

CORDELIA:
O, look upon me, sir,
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
No, sir, you must not kneel.

CORDELIA:
And so I am, I am.

CORDELIA:
No cause, no cause.

Doctor:
Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
Till further settling.

CORDELIA:
Will't please your highness walk?

EDMUND:
'Tis to be doubted, madam.

EDMUND:
In honour'd love.

EDMUND:
That thought abuses you.

EDMUND:
No, by mine honour, madam.

EDMUND:
Fear me not:
She and the duke her husband!

ALBANY:
Our very loving sister, well be-met.
Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
With others whom the rigor of our state
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
I never yet was valiant: for this business,
It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

EDMUND:
Sir, you speak nobly.

ALBANY:
Let's then determine
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.

EDMUND:
I shall attend you presently at your tent.

EDGAR:
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
Hear me one word.

ALBANY:
I'll overtake you. Speak.

EDGAR:
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.

ALBANY:
Stay till I have read the letter.

EDGAR:
I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
And I'll appear again.

ALBANY:
Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.

EDMUND:
The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
By diligent discovery; but your haste
Is now urged on you.

ALBANY:
We will greet the time.

EDMUND:
To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Each jealous of the other, as the stung
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
If both remain alive: to take the widow
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
His countenance for the battle; which being done,
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
The battle done, and they within our power,
Shall never see his pardon; for my state
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

EDGAR:
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
If ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.

EDGAR:
Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.

EDGAR:
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
Ripeness is all: come on.

EDMUND:
Some officers take them away: good guard,
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them.

CORDELIA:
We are not the first
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

EDMUND:
Take them away.

EDMUND:
Come hither, captain; hark.
Take thou this note;
go follow them to prison:
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
Does not become a sword: thy great employment
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
Or thrive by other means.

Captain:
I'll do 't, my lord.

EDMUND:
About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
As I have set it down.

Captain:
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
If it be man's work, I'll do 't.

ALBANY:
Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well: you have the captives
That were the opposites of this day's strife:
We do require them of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.

EDMUND:
Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness:
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.

ALBANY:
Sir, by your patience,
I hold you but a subject of this war,
Not as a brother.

ALBANY:
The let-alone lies not in your good will.

EDMUND:
Nor in thine, lord.

ALBANY:
Half-blooded fellow, yes.

ALBANY:
Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
This gilded serpent
For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife:
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
If you will marry, make your loves to me,
My lady is bespoke.

ALBANY:
Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
If none appear to prove upon thy head
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
There is my pledge;
I'll prove it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

EDMUND:
There's my exchange:
what in the world he is
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly.

ALBANY:
A herald, ho!

EDMUND:
A herald, ho, a herald!

ALBANY:
Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Took their discharge.

ALBANY:
She is not well; convey her to my tent.
Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
And read out this.

Captain:
Sound, trumpet!

EDMUND:
Sound!

ALBANY:
Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Upon this call o' the trumpet.

EDGAR:
Know, my name is lost;
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.

ALBANY:
Which is that adversary?

EDGAR:
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

EDMUND:
Himself: what say'st thou to him?

EDGAR:
Draw thy sword,
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.

EDMUND:
In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!

ALBANY:
Save him, save him!

ALBANY:
Shut your mouth, dame,
Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.

ALBANY:
Most monstrous! oh!
Know'st thou this paper?

ALBANY:
Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

EDMUND:
What you have charged me with, that have I done;
And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
I do forgive thee.

EDGAR:
Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.

EDMUND:
Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.

ALBANY:
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father!

EDGAR:
Worthy prince, I know't.

ALBANY:
Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?

EDGAR:
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape,
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.

EDMUND:
This speech of yours hath moved me,
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.

ALBANY:
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this.

EDGAR:
This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.

ALBANY:
But who was this?

EDGAR:
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.

EDGAR:
What kind of help?

ALBANY:
Speak, man.

EDGAR:
What means that bloody knife?

ALBANY:
Who dead? speak, man.

EDMUND:
I was contracted to them both: all three
Now marry in an instant.

EDGAR:
Here comes Kent.

ALBANY:
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
Touches us not with pity.
O, is this he?
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges.

ALBANY:
Great thing of us forgot!
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
See'st thou this object, Kent?

EDMUND:
Yet Edmund was beloved:
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
And after slew herself.

ALBANY:
Even so. Cover their faces.

EDMUND:
I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
Nay, send in time.

ALBANY:
Run, run, O, run!

EDGAR:
To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
Thy token of reprieve.

EDMUND:
Well thought on: take my sword,
Give it the captain.

ALBANY:
Haste thee, for thy life.

EDMUND:
He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
That she fordid herself.

ALBANY:
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

EDGAR:
Or image of that horror?

ALBANY:
Fall, and cease!

EDGAR:
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

Captain:
'Tis true, my lords, he did.

ALBANY:
He knows not what he says: and vain it is
That we present us to him.

EDGAR:
Very bootless.

Captain:
Edmund is dead, my lord.

ALBANY:
That's but a trifle here.
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
During the life of this old majesty,
To him our absolute power:
you, to your rights:
With boot, and such addition as your honours
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

EDGAR:
He faints! My lord, my lord!

EDGAR:
Look up, my lord.

EDGAR:
He is gone, indeed.

ALBANY:
Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe.
Friends of my soul, you twain
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.

ALBANY:
The weight of this sad time we must obey;
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

CLEOPATRA:
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

CLEOPATRA:
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

Attendant:
News, my good lord, from Rome.

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, hear them, Antony:
Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'

CLEOPATRA:
Perchance! nay, and most like:
You must not stay here longer, your dismission
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

CLEOPATRA:
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
Will be himself.

CLEOPATRA:
Hear the ambassadors.

DEMETRIUS:
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

DEMETRIUS:
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

CHARMIAN:
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!

ALEXAS:
Soothsayer!

CHARMIAN:
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

ALEXAS:
Show him your hand.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.

CHARMIAN:
Good sir, give me good fortune.

CHARMIAN:
Pray, then, foresee me one.

CHARMIAN:
He means in flesh.

CHARMIAN:
Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS:
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

CHARMIAN:
Hush!

CHARMIAN:
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS:
Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN:
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

CHARMIAN:
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

CHARMIAN:
Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

CHARMIAN:
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

ALEXAS:
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

CHARMIAN:
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

ALEXAS:
We'll know all our fortunes.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
be--drunk to bed.

CHARMIAN:
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

CHARMIAN:
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.

CHARMIAN:
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
I, where would you choose it?

CHARMIAN:
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

CHARMIAN:
Amen.

ALEXAS:
Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
they'ld do't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Hush! here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN:
Not he; the queen.

CLEOPATRA:
Saw you my lord?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No, lady.

CLEOPATRA:
Was he not here?

CHARMIAN:
No, madam.

CLEOPATRA:
He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Madam?

CLEOPATRA:
Seek him, and bring him hither.
Where's Alexas?

ALEXAS:
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

CLEOPATRA:
We will not look upon him: go with us.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What's your pleasure, sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Fulvia!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
out, there are members to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And the business you have broached here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
wholly depends on your abode.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall do't.

CLEOPATRA:
Where is he?

CHARMIAN:
I did not see him since.

CLEOPATRA:
See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
I did not send you: if you find him sad,
Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.

CHARMIAN:
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.

CLEOPATRA:
What should I do, I do not?

CHARMIAN:
In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.

CLEOPATRA:
Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.

CHARMIAN:
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.

CLEOPATRA:
I am sick and sullen.

CLEOPATRA:
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.

CLEOPATRA:
Pray you, stand further from me.

CLEOPATRA:
I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
What says the married woman? You may go:
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
I have no power upon you; hers you are.

CLEOPATRA:
O, never was there queen
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.

CLEOPATRA:
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
Then was the time for words: no going then;
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Art turn'd the greatest liar.

CLEOPATRA:
I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.

CLEOPATRA:
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?

CLEOPATRA:
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.

CLEOPATRA:
Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
So Antony loves.

CLEOPATRA:
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
Life perfect honour.

CLEOPATRA:
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

CLEOPATRA:
And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe.

CLEOPATRA:
Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
That you know well: something it is I would,
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
And I am all forgotten.

CLEOPATRA:
'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!

CLEOPATRA:
Charmian!

CHARMIAN:
Madam?

CLEOPATRA:
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN:
Why, madam?

CLEOPATRA:
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.

CHARMIAN:
You think of him too much.

CLEOPATRA:
O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN:
Madam, I trust, not so.

CLEOPATRA:
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

CLEOPATRA:
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

CLEOPATRA:
Indeed!

CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian,
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
For so he calls me: now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.

ALEXAS:
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

CLEOPATRA:
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS:
Last thing he did, dear queen,
He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

CLEOPATRA:
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS:
'Good friend,' quoth he,
'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb'd by him.

CLEOPATRA:
What, was he sad or merry?

ALEXAS:
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

CLEOPATRA:
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

ALEXAS:
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA:
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony,
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN:
O that brave Caesar!

CLEOPATRA:
Be choked with such another emphasis!
Say, the brave Antony.

CHARMIAN:
The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA:
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.

CHARMIAN:
By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA:
My salad days,
When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
To say as I said then! But, come, away;
Get me ink and paper:
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
Let Antony look over Caesar's head
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
I would not shave't to-day.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Every time
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not if the small come first.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And yonder, Caesar.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
to wars with the women!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Go to, then; your considerate stone.

AGRIPPA:
Give me leave, Caesar,--

AGRIPPA:
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
Is now a widower.

AGRIPPA:
To hold you in perpetual amity,
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot, take Antony
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men;
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
All little jealousies, which now seem great,
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
Would, each to other and all loves to both,
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
By duty ruminated.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
honourable friend, Agrippa!

AGRIPPA:
Good Enobarbus!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
made the night light with drinking.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.

AGRIPPA:
There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
well for her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description: she did lie
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.

AGRIPPA:
O, rare for Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
And made their bends adornings: at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
And made a gap in nature.

AGRIPPA:
Rare Egyptian!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper: she replied,
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.

AGRIPPA:
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, power breathe forth.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Never; he will not:
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety: other women cloy
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.

AGRIPPA:
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Humbly, sir, I thank you.

AGRIPPA:
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

CLEOPATRA:
Give me some music; music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.

Attendants:
The music, ho!

CLEOPATRA:
Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN:
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

CLEOPATRA:
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

CLEOPATRA:
And when good will is show'd, though't come
too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
I'll think them every one an Antony,
And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'

CHARMIAN:
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.

CLEOPATRA:
That time,--O times!--
I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
O, from Italy
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
That long time have been barren.

CLEOPATRA:
Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

CLEOPATRA:
Why, there's more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.

CLEOPATRA:
Well, go to, I will;
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
Not like a formal man.

CLEOPATRA:
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.

CLEOPATRA:
Well said.

CLEOPATRA:
Thou'rt an honest man.

CLEOPATRA:
Make thee a fortune from me.

CLEOPATRA:
I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.

CLEOPATRA:
For what good turn?

CLEOPATRA:
I am pale, Charmian.

CLEOPATRA:
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

CLEOPATRA:
What say you? Hence,
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in lingering pickle.

CLEOPATRA:
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.

CLEOPATRA:
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.

CHARMIAN:
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent.

CLEOPATRA:
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.

CHARMIAN:
He is afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA:
I will not hurt him.
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.
Come hither, sir.
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt.

CLEOPATRA:
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
If thou again say 'Yes.'

CLEOPATRA:
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?

CLEOPATRA:
O, I would thou didst,
So half my Egypt were submerged and made
A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

CLEOPATRA:
He is married?

CLEOPATRA:
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
And be undone by 'em!

CHARMIAN:
Good your highness, patience.

CLEOPATRA:
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.

CHARMIAN:
Many times, madam.

CLEOPATRA:
I am paid for't now.
Lead me from hence:
I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
Her inclination, let him not leave out
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No more of that: he did so.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Well;
And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
Four feasts are toward.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Sir,
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
At sea, I think.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
You have done well by water.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Yes, something you can deny for your own
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
There I deny my land service. But give me your
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
might take two thieves kissing.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
We came hither to fight with you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
'Tis true.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
not prophesy so.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Here's to thee, Menas!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Drink thou; increase the reels.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ha, my brave emperor!
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round,
Cup us, till the world go round!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Take heed you fall not.
Menas, I'll not on shore.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ho! says a' There's my cap.

AGRIPPA:
What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA:
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA:
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA:
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA:
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA:
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA:
Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
They are his shards, and he their beetle.
So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA:
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

AGRIPPA:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

AGRIPPA:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

CLEOPATRA:
Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS:
Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA:
Go to, go to.
Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS:
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA:
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

CLEOPATRA:
Didst thou behold Octavia?

CLEOPATRA:
Where?

CLEOPATRA:
Is she as tall as me?

CLEOPATRA:
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

CLEOPATRA:
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN:
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA:
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

CLEOPATRA:
Is this certain?

CHARMIAN:
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA:
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN:
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA:
Guess at her years, I prithee.

CLEOPATRA:
Widow! Charmian, hark.

CLEOPATRA:
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

CLEOPATRA:
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?

CLEOPATRA:
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.

CHARMIAN:
A proper man.

CLEOPATRA:
Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN:
Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA:
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN:
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA:
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN:
I warrant you, madam.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
How now, friend Eros!

EROS:
There's strange news come, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What, man?

EROS:
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
This is old: what is the success?

EROS:
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS:
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS:
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
'Twill be naught:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS:
Come, sir.

AGRIPPA:
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

AGRIPPA:
Who does he accuse?

AGRIPPA:
Sir, this should be answer'd.

AGRIPPA:
Welcome, lady.

CLEOPATRA:
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But why, why, why?

CLEOPATRA:
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA:
If not denounced against us, why should not we
Be there in person?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

CLEOPATRA:
What is't you say?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain,
from's time,
What should not then be spared. He is already
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA:
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
I will not stay behind.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the emperor.

CLEOPATRA:
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent.

CLEOPATRA:
By sea! what else?

CANIDIUS:
Why will my lord do so?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

CANIDIUS:
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
And so should you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepared for land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
From firm security.

CLEOPATRA:
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

CANIDIUS:
Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
And we are women's men.

CANIDIUS:
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.

CANIDIUS:
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

CANIDIUS:
Well I know the man.

CANIDIUS:
With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
Each minute, some.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
To see't mine eyes are blasted.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What's thy passion!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
How appears the fight?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
Endure a further view.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alack, alack!

CANIDIUS:
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
O, he has given example for our flight,
Most grossly, by his own!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS:
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

CANIDIUS:
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse: six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.

All:
Fly! not we.

EROS:
Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

CHARMIAN:
Do! why: what else?

CLEOPATRA:
Let me sit down. O Juno!

EROS:
See you here, sir?

CHARMIAN:
Madam!

EROS:
Sir, sir,--

CLEOPATRA:
Ah, stand by.

EROS:
The queen, my lord, the queen.

CLEOPATRA:
Well then, sustain him: O!

EROS:
Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
Your comfort makes the rescue.

EROS:
Sir, the queen.

CLEOPATRA:
O my lord, my lord,
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
You would have follow'd.

CLEOPATRA:
O, my pardon!

CLEOPATRA:
Pardon, pardon!

DOLABELLA:
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.

EUPHRONIUS:
Such as I am, I come from Antony:
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
To his grand sea.

EUPHRONIUS:
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
A private man in Athens: this for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.

EUPHRONIUS:
Fortune pursue thee!

CLEOPATRA:
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA:
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA:
Prithee, peace.

EUPHRONIUS:
Ay, my lord.

EUPHRONIUS:
He says so.

CLEOPATRA:
That head, my lord?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

Attendant:
A messenger from CAESAR.

CLEOPATRA:
What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

CLEOPATRA:
Caesar's will?

CLEOPATRA:
None but friends: say boldly.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.

CLEOPATRA:
Go on: right royal.

CLEOPATRA:
O!

CLEOPATRA:
He is a god, and knows
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

CLEOPATRA:
What's your name?

CLEOPATRA:
Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.

CLEOPATRA:
Your Caesar's father oft,
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
As it rain'd kisses.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

CLEOPATRA:
Good my lord,--

CLEOPATRA:
O, is't come to this?

CLEOPATRA:
Wherefore is this?

CLEOPATRA:
Have you done yet?

CLEOPATRA:
I must stay his time.

CLEOPATRA:
Not know me yet?

CLEOPATRA:
Ah, dear, if I be so,
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
And poison it in the source; and the first stone
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey!

CLEOPATRA:
That's my brave lord!

CLEOPATRA:
It is my birth-day:
I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA:
Call all his noble captains to my lord.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
A diminution in our captain's brain
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
Some way to leave him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

CLEOPATRA:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

All:
The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
Transform us not to women.

All:

All:
Content. 'Tis strange.

CLEOPATRA:
Sleep a little.

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?

CLEOPATRA:
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.

EROS:
Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA:
Is not this buckled well?

Captain:
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

All:
Good morrow, general.

CHARMIAN:
Please you, retire to your chamber.

CLEOPATRA:
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.

EROS:
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.

AGRIPPA:
Caesar, I shall.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
And leave his master Antony: for this pains
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honourable trust. I have done ill;
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
That I will joy no more.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I give it you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.

AGRIPPA:
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.

EROS:
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.

CLEOPATRA:
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?

CLEOPATRA:
I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O, bear me witness, night,--

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular;
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!

CLEOPATRA:
Why is my lord enraged against his love?

CLEOPATRA:
Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so emboss'd.

CHARMIAN:
To the monument!
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.

CLEOPATRA:
To the monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death.
To the monument!

EROS:
Ay, noble lord.

EROS:
Ay, my lord,

EROS:
It does, my lord.

EROS:
What would my lord?

EROS:
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?

EROS:
I would not see't.

EROS:
O, sir, pardon me!

EROS:
Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

EROS:
My sword is drawn.

EROS:
My dear master,
My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

EROS:
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

EROS:
Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
Of Antony's death.

All:
Alas, and woe!

DERCETAS:
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
Shall enter me with him.

DIOMEDES:
Where's Antony?

DERCETAS:
There, Diomed there.

DIOMEDES:
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?

DIOMEDES:
Most absolute lord,
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

DIOMEDES:
Now, my lord.

DIOMEDES:
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
Which never shall be found--you did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.

DIOMEDES:
What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
Come, your lord calls!

All:
Most heavy day!

CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

CHARMIAN:
Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA:
No, I will not:
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it.
How now! is he dead?

DIOMEDES:
His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' the other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.

CLEOPATRA:
O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
darkling stand
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.

CLEOPATRA:
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

CLEOPATRA:
I dare not, dear,--
Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
Assist, good friends.

CLEOPATRA:
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;
And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.

All:
A heavy sight!

CLEOPATRA:
No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
Provoked by my offence.

CLEOPATRA:
They do not go together.

CLEOPATRA:
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar.

CLEOPATRA:
Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.

CHARMIAN:
O, quietness, lady!

CHARMIAN:
Lady!

CHARMIAN:
O madam, madam, madam!

CHARMIAN:
Peace, peace, Iras!

CLEOPATRA:
No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
Patience is scottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death,
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
what's noble,
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
But resolution, and the briefest end.

DOLABELLA:
Caesar, I shall.

DERCETAS:
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
He was my master; and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.

DERCETAS:
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

DERCETAS:
He is dead, Caesar:
Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.

AGRIPPA:
And strange it is,
That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds.

AGRIPPA:
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

Egyptian:
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
Confined in all she has, her monument,
Of thy intents desires instruction,
That she preparedly may frame herself
To the way she's forced to.

Egyptian:
So the gods preserve thee!

All:
Dolabella!

CLEOPATRA:
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
A minister of her will: and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.

CLEOPATRA:
What's thy name?

CLEOPATRA:
Antony
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
I do not greatly care to be deceived,
That have no use for trusting. If your master
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
He gives me so much of mine own, as I
Will kneel to him with thanks.

CLEOPATRA:
Pray you, tell him
I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
Look him i' the face.

CHARMIAN:
O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:

CLEOPATRA:
Quick, quick, good hands.

CLEOPATRA:
What, of death too,
That rids our dogs of languish?

CLEOPATRA:
Where art thou, death?
Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
Worthy many babes and beggars!

CLEOPATRA:
Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
If idle talk will once be necessary,
I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
Blow me into abhorring! rather make
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
And hang me up in chains!

DOLABELLA:
Proculeius,
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
I'll take her to my guard.

CLEOPATRA:
Say, I would die.

DOLABELLA:
Most noble empress, you have heard of me?

CLEOPATRA:
I cannot tell.

DOLABELLA:
Assuredly you know me.

CLEOPATRA:
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
Is't not your trick?

DOLABELLA:
I understand not, madam.

CLEOPATRA:
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
O, such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man!

DOLABELLA:
If it might please ye,--

CLEOPATRA:
His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course,
and lighted
The little O, the earth.

DOLABELLA:
Most sovereign creature,--

CLEOPATRA:
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
Crested the world: his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
The element they lived in: in his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA:
Cleopatra!

CLEOPATRA:
Think you there was, or might be, such a man
As this I dream'd of?

DOLABELLA:
Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA:
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA:
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight: would I might never
O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA:
I thank you, sir,
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA:
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you, sir,--

DOLABELLA:
Though he be honourable,--

CLEOPATRA:
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA:
Madam, he will; I know't.

DOLABELLA:
It is the emperor, madam.

CLEOPATRA:
Sir, the gods
Will have it thus; my master and my lord
I must obey.

CLEOPATRA:
Sole sir o' the world,
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear; but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often shamed our sex.

CLEOPATRA:
And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

CLEOPATRA:
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

CLEOPATRA:
This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserved
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

CLEOPATRA:
What have I kept back?

CLEOPATRA:
See, Caesar! O, behold,
How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!

CLEOPATRA:
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I some lady trifles have reserved,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation; must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
Beneath the fall I have.
Prithee, go hence;
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

CLEOPATRA:
Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and, when we fall,
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.

CLEOPATRA:
My master, and my lord!

CLEOPATRA:
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.

CLEOPATRA:
Hie thee again:
I have spoke already, and it is provided;
Go put it to the haste.

CHARMIAN:
Madam, I will.

DOLABELLA:
Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN:
Behold, sir.

CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella!

DOLABELLA:
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
Which my love makes religion to obey,
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey; and within three days
You with your children will he send before:
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.

CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella,
I shall remain your debtor.

DOLABELLA:
I your servant,
Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.

CLEOPATRA:
Farewell, and thanks.
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
And forced to drink their vapour.

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us, and present
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' the posture of a whore.

CLEOPATRA:
Nay, that's certain.

CLEOPATRA:
Why, that's the way
To fool their preparation, and to conquer
Their most absurd intents.
Now, Charmian!
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
Wherefore's this noise?

CLEOPATRA:
Let him come in.
What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
Of woman in me: now from head to foot
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.

CLEOPATRA:
Avoid, and leave him.
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
That kills and pains not?

Clown:
Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover.

CLEOPATRA:
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?

Clown:
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
but something given to lie; as a woman should not
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
worm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA:
Get thee hence; farewell.

Clown:
I wish you all joy of the worm.

CLEOPATRA:
Farewell.

Clown:
You must think this, look you, that the worm will
do his kind.

CLEOPATRA:
Ay, ay; farewell.

Clown:
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
goodness in worm.

CLEOPATRA:
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

Clown:
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
not worth the feeding.

CLEOPATRA:
Will it eat me?

Clown:
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make, the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA:
Well, get thee gone; farewell.

Clown:
Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.

CLEOPATRA:
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me: now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So; have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.

CHARMIAN:
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
The gods themselves do weep!

CLEOPATRA:
This proves me base:
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
mortal wretch,
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!

CHARMIAN:
O eastern star!

CLEOPATRA:
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
That sucks the nurse asleep?

CHARMIAN:
O, break! O, break!

CLEOPATRA:
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
What should I stay--

CHARMIAN:
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it, and then play.

CHARMIAN:
Speak softly, wake her not.

CHARMIAN:
Too slow a messenger.
O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

CHARMIAN:
It is well done, and fitting for a princess
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!

DOLABELLA:
How goes it here?

DOLABELLA:
Caesar, thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.

DOLABELLA:
O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
That you did fear is done.

DOLABELLA:
Who was last with them?

DOLABELLA:
Here, on her breast,
There is a vent of blood and something blown:
The like is on her arm.

ADAM:
Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ADAM:
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
remembrance, be at accord.

ADAM:
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.

DENNIS:
Calls your worship?

DENNIS:
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
access to you.

CHARLES:
Good morrow to your worship.

CHARLES:
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

CHARLES:
O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.

CHARLES:
They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

CHARLES:
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will.

CHARLES:
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
so God keep your worship!

CELIA:
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

CELIA:
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.

CELIA:
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

CELIA:
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.

CELIA:
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

CELIA:
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly.

CELIA:
No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

CELIA:
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
wit! whither wander you?

CELIA:
Were you made the messenger?

CELIA:
How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?

CELIA:
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

CELIA:
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

CELIA:
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.

CELIA:
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.

CELIA:
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

CELIA:
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

CELIA:
Sport! of what colour?

CELIA:
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

CELIA:
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

CELIA:
I could match this beginning with an old tale.

CELIA:
Or I, I promise thee.

CELIA:
Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
own peril on his forwardness.

CELIA:
Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.

DUKE FREDERICK:
How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
to see the wrestling?

DUKE FREDERICK:
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
you can move him.

CELIA:
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Do so: I'll not be by.

CELIA:
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

CELIA:
And mine, to eke out hers.

CELIA:
Your heart's desires be with you!

CHARLES:
Come, where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth?

DUKE FREDERICK:
You shall try but one fall.

CHARLES:
No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first.

CELIA:
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
fellow by the leg.

CELIA:
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
should down.

DUKE FREDERICK:
No more, no more.

DUKE FREDERICK:
How dost thou, Charles?

DUKE FREDERICK:
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

DUKE FREDERICK:
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
But I did find him still mine enemy:
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.

CELIA:
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

CELIA:
Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.

CELIA:
Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.

CELIA:
Will you go, coz?

CELIA:
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?

CELIA:
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.

CELIA:
But is all this for your father?

CELIA:
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.

CELIA:
Hem them away.

CELIA:
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

CELIA:
O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

CELIA:
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.

CELIA:
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?

CELIA:
With his eyes full of anger.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court.

DUKE FREDERICK:
You, cousin
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
So near our public court as twenty miles,
Thou diest for it.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.

CELIA:
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA:
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK:
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.

CELIA:
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
I cannot live out of her company.

DUKE FREDERICK:
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
And in the greatness of my word, you die.

CELIA:
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

CELIA:
Thou hast not, cousin;
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

CELIA:
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

CELIA:
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

CELIA:
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.

CELIA:
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

CELIA:
Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia, but Aliena.

CELIA:
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.

DUKE SENIOR:
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.

AMIENS:
Happy is your grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

DUKE SENIOR:
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.

DUKE SENIOR:
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?

DUKE SENIOR:
And did you leave him in this contemplation?

DUKE SENIOR:
Show me the place:
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
For then he's full of matter.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be: some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways.

ADAM:
What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
O my sweet master! O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!

ADAM:
O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
Yet not the son, I will not call him son
Of him I was about to call his father--
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it: if he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practises.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

ADAM:
No matter whither, so you come not here.

ADAM:
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.

ADAM:
Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

CELIA:
I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.

CORIN:
That is the way to make her scorn you still.

CORIN:
I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.

CORIN:
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

CELIA:
I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.

CORIN:
Who calls?

CORIN:
Else are they very wretched.

CORIN:
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

CORIN:
Fair sir, I pity her
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

CORIN:
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying any thing.

CELIA:
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
And willingly could waste my time in it.

CORIN:
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like upon report
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

AMIENS:
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.

AMIENS:
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.

AMIENS:
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.

AMIENS:
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

AMIENS:
More at your request than to please myself.

AMIENS:
Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
this day to look you.

AMIENS:
And I'll sing it.

AMIENS:
What's that 'ducdame'?

AMIENS:
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

ADAM:
Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
kind master.

DUKE SENIOR:
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can no where find him like a man.

DUKE SENIOR:
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

DUKE SENIOR:
Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily!

DUKE SENIOR:
What fool is this?

DUKE SENIOR:
Thou shalt have one.

DUKE SENIOR:
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

DUKE SENIOR:
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

DUKE SENIOR:
Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in civility thou seem'st so empty?

DUKE SENIOR:
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.

DUKE SENIOR:
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

DUKE SENIOR:
True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.

DUKE SENIOR:
Go find him out,
And we will nothing waste till you return.

DUKE SENIOR:
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.

DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
And let him feed.

ADAM:
So had you need:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.

AMIENS:
Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly.
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot:
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remember'd not.
Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

DUKE SENIOR:
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand.

DUKE FREDERICK:
Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
But were I not the better part made mercy,
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
Of what we think against thee.

DUKE FREDERICK:
More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands:
Do this expediently and turn him going.

CORIN:
And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?

CORIN:
No more but that I know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
means and content is without three good friends;
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.

CORIN:
No, truly.

CORIN:
Nay, I hope.

CORIN:
For not being at court? Your reason.

CORIN:
Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.

CORIN:
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
fells, you know, are greasy.

CORIN:
Besides, our hands are hard.

CORIN:
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.

CORIN:
You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.

CORIN:
Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck.

CORIN:
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

CELIA:

CELIA:
How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
Go with him, sirrah.

CELIA:
Didst thou hear these verses?

CELIA:
That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.

CELIA:
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

CELIA:
Trow you who hath done this?

CELIA:
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
Change you colour?

CELIA:
O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter.

CELIA:
Is it possible?

CELIA:
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
out of all hooping!

CELIA:
So you may put a man in your belly.

CELIA:
Nay, he hath but a little beard.

CELIA:
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
heels and your heart both in an instant.

CELIA:
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

CELIA:
Orlando.

CELIA:
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism.

CELIA:
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
finding him, and relish it with good observance.
I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.

CELIA:
Give me audience, good madam.

CELIA:
There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.

CELIA:
Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.

CELIA:
I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
me out of tune.

CELIA:
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?

AUDREY:
Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!

AUDREY:
I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
deed and word? is it a true thing?

AUDREY:
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

AUDREY:
Would you not have me honest?

AUDREY:
Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
make me honest.

AUDREY:
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

AUDREY:
Well, the gods give us joy!

CELIA:
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.

CELIA:
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.

CELIA:
Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
Judas's own children.

CELIA:
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

CELIA:
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
the very ice of chastity is in them.

CELIA:
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

CELIA:
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.

CELIA:
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

CELIA:
'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.

CELIA:
O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
guides. Who comes here?

CORIN:
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.

CELIA:
Well, and what of him?

CORIN:
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
If you will mark it.

CELIA:
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
Rosalind of a better leer than you.

CELIA:
I cannot say the words.

CELIA:
Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?

CELIA:
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
her own nest.

CELIA:
Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
affection in, it runs out.

CELIA:
And I'll sleep.

A Lord:
Sir, it was I.

CELIA:
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
sleep. Look, who comes here.

CELIA:
Alas, poor shepherd!

CELIA:
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
There's none within.

CELIA:
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

CELIA:
I pray you, tell it.

CELIA:
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.

CELIA:
Are you his brother?

CELIA:
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

CELIA:
Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

CELIA:
There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

CELIA:
We'll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

CELIA:
Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
homewards. Good sir, go with us.

AUDREY:
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
gentleman's saying.

AUDREY:
Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
the world: here comes the man you mean.

AUDREY:
God ye good even, William.

AUDREY:
Do, good William.

CORIN:
Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!

AUDREY:
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.

DUKE SENIOR:
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
Can do all this that he hath promised?

DUKE SENIOR:
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

DUKE SENIOR:
I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

DUKE SENIOR:
I like him very well.

DUKE SENIOR:
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

DUKE SENIOR:
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

DUKE SENIOR:
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

DUKE SENIOR:
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome, young man;
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
To one his lands withheld, and to the other
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest, let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot:
And after, every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

DUKE SENIOR:
Stay, Jaques, stay.

DUKE SENIOR:
Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

ANTONIO:
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?

ANTONIO:
Why, what of him?

ANTONIO:
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I have consider'd well his loss of time
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Experience is by industry achieved
And perfected by the swift course of time.
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?

ANTONIO:
I know it well.

ANTONIO:
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
The execution of it shall make known.
Even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.

ANTONIO:
Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
And, in good time! now will we break with him.

ANTONIO:
How now! what letter are you reading there?

ANTONIO:
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.

ANTONIO:
And how stand you affected to his wish?

ANTONIO:
My will is something sorted with his wish.
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
For what I will, I will, and there an end.
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
What maintenance he from his friends receives,
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.

ANTONIO:
Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
To hasten on his expedition.

DUKE:
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?

DUKE:
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?

DUKE:
Hath he not a son?

DUKE:
You know him well?

DUKE:
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
He is as worthy for an empress' love
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
With commendation from great potentates;
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

DUKE:
Welcome him then according to his worth.
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
I will send him hither to you presently.

DUKE:
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
We have some secrets to confer about.
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?

DUKE:
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

DUKE:
Upon mine honour, he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this.

DUKE:
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

DUKE:
Be they of much import?

DUKE:
Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

DUKE:
No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
I now am full resolved to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.

DUKE:
There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
For long agone I have forgot to court;
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

DUKE:
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

DUKE:
But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her.

DUKE:
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night.

DUKE:
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life.

DUKE:
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

DUKE:
This very night; for Love is like a child,
That longs for every thing that he can come by.

DUKE:
But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

DUKE:
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

DUKE:
Then let me see thy cloak:
I'll get me one of such another length.

DUKE:
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
What's here?
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.

DUKE:
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.

DUKE:
This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
According to our proclamation gone?

DUKE:
My daughter takes his going grievously.

DUKE:
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Makes me the better to confer with thee.

DUKE:
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.

DUKE:
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will

DUKE:
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

DUKE:
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

DUKE:
Then you must undertake to slander him.

DUKE:
Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Your slander never can endamage him;
Therefore the office is indifferent,
Being entreated to it by your friend.

DUKE:
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
You are already Love's firm votary
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

DUKE:
Ay,
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

DUKE:
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

DUKE:
About it, gentlemen!

DUKE:
Even now about it! I will pardon you.

EGLAMOUR:
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind:
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
Madam, madam!

EGLAMOUR:
Your servant and your friend;
One that attends your ladyship's command.

EGLAMOUR:
As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
According to your ladyship's impose,
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in.

EGLAMOUR:
Madam, I pity much your grievances;
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
I give consent to go along with you,
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go?

EGLAMOUR:
Where shall I meet you?

EGLAMOUR:
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.

EGLAMOUR:
The sun begins to gild the western sky;
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time;
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes.
Lady, a happy evening!

EGLAMOUR:
Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.

DUKE:
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

DUKE:
Saw you my daughter?

DUKE:
Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

DUKE:
Sir Valentine!

DUKE:
The more degenerate and base art thou,
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

DUKE:
I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.

DUKE:
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Come, let us go: we will include all jars
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.

DUKE:
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

DUKE:
What mean you by that saying?

ANTIOCHUS:
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
The danger of the task you undertake.

ANTIOCHUS:
Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
For the embracements even of Jove himself;
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
The senate-house of planets all did sit,
To knit in her their best perfections.

ANTIOCHUS:
Prince Pericles,--

ANTIOCHUS:
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
And which, without desert, because thine eye
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on death's net, whom none resist.

ANTIOCHUS:
Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.

Daughter:
Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!

ANTIOCHUS:
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
For that's an article within our law,
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.

ANTIOCHUS:

ANTIOCHUS:
He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
To have his head.
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
In such a loathed manner;
And therefore instantly this prince must die:
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
Who attends us there?

ANTIOCHUS:
Thaliard,
You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
Her private actions to your secrecy;
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?

ANTIOCHUS:
Enough.
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.

ANTIOCHUS:
As thou
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'

ANTIOCHUS:
Thaliard, adieu!
Till Pericles be dead,
My heart can lend no succor to my head.

CLEON:
My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
And by relating tales of others' griefs,
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?

DIONYZA:
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
For who digs hills because they do aspire
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

CLEON:
O Dionyza,
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

DIONYZA:
I'll do my best, sir.

CLEON:
This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
Like one another's glass to trim them by:
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
And not so much to feed on as delight;
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
The name of help grew odious to repeat.

DIONYZA:
O, 'tis too true.

CLEON:
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
Were all too little to content and please,
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
As houses are defiled for want of use,
They are now starved for want of exercise:
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Is not this true?

DIONYZA:
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

CLEON:
O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
And her prosperities so largely taste,
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.

CLEON:
Here.
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
For comfort is too far for us to expect.

CLEON:
I thought as much.
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
That may succeed as his inheritor;
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
Taking advantage of our misery,
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
To beat us down, the which are down already;
And make a conquest of unhappy me,
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.

CLEON:
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
But bring they what they will and what they can,
What need we fear?
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
Go tell their general we attend him here,
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
And what he craves.

CLEON:
Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
If wars, we are unable to resist.

All:
The gods of Greece protect you!
And we'll pray for you.

CLEON:
The which when any shall not gratify,
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.

ESCANES:
'Twas very strange.

ESCANES:
'Tis very true.

All:
Live, noble Helicane!

BOTH:
Yes, if it please your majesty.

CERIMON:
Philemon, ho!

CERIMON:
Get fire and meat for these poor men:
'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.

CERIMON:
Your master will be dead ere you return;
There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
That can recover him.
Give this to the 'pothecary,
And tell me how it works.

CERIMON:
Gentlemen,
Why do you stir so early?

CERIMON:
O, you say well.

CERIMON:
I hold it ever,
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
May the two latter darken and expend;
But immortality attends the former.
Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
Have studied physic, through which secret art,
By turning o'er authorities, I have,
Together with my practise, made familiar
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
And I can speak of the disturbances
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
A more content in course of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
To please the fool and death.

CERIMON:
What is that?

CERIMON:
Set 't down, let's look upon't.

CERIMON:
Whate'er it be,
'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.

CERIMON:
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
Did the sea cast it up?

CERIMON:
Wrench it open;
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.

CERIMON:
As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!

CERIMON:
Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
With full bags of spices! A passport too!
Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
'Here I give to understand,
If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
I, King Pericles, have lost
This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
Who finds her, give her burying;
She was the daughter of a king:
Besides this treasure for a fee,
The gods requite his charity!'
If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.

CERIMON:
Nay, certainly to-night;
For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
Death may usurp on nature many hours,
And yet the fire of life kindle again
The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
That had nine hours lien dead,
Who was by good appliance recovered.
Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
The rough and woeful music that we have,
Cause it to sound, beseech you.
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
Gentlemen.
This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
Into life's flower again!

CERIMON:
She is alive; behold,
Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
Which Pericles hath lost,
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
The diamonds of a most praised water
Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
Rare as you seem to be.

CERIMON:
Hush, my gentle neighbours!
Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,
For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;
And AEsculapius guide us!

CLEON:
Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
Yet glance full wanderingly on us.

DIONYZA:
O your sweet queen!
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
To have bless'd mine eyes with her!

CLEON:
Fear not, my lord, but think
Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
Should therein make me vile, the common body,
By you relieved, would force me to my duty:
But if to that my nature need a spur,
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
To the end of generation!

DIONYZA:
I have one myself,
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours, my lord.

CLEON:
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
The gentlest winds of heaven.

CERIMON:
Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
At your command. Know you the character?

CERIMON:
Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana's temple is not distant far,
Where you may abide till your date expire.
Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
Shall there attend you.

DIONYZA:
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
A soldier to thy purpose.

DIONYZA:
The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
Thou art resolved?

DIONYZA:
How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
With this unprofitable woe!
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.

DIONYZA:
Come, come;
I love the king your father, and yourself,
With more than foreign heart. We every day
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
That excellent complexion, which did steal
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
I can go home alone.

DIONYZA:
Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
Remember what I have said.

DIONYZA:
I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
What! I must have a care of you.

BOULT:
Sir?

Bawd:
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
poor three, and they can do no more than they can
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.

Bawd:
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--

BOULT:
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
shall I search the market?

Bawd:
What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.

BOULT:
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat
for worms. But I'll go search the market.

Bawd:
Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
when we are old?

Bawd:
Come, other sorts offend as well as we.

BOULT:

BOULT:
Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:
if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.

Bawd:
Boult, has she any qualities?

BOULT:
She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
good clothes: there's no further necessity of
qualities can make her be refused.

Bawd:
What's her price, Boult?

BOULT:
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.

Bawd:
Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
as I command you.

BOULT:
Performance shall follow.

Bawd:
Why lament you, pretty one?

Bawd:
Come, the gods have done their part in you.

Bawd:
You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.

Bawd:
Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.

Bawd:
Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?

Bawd:
What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?

Bawd:
Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
something to do with you. Come, you're a young
foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
you.

Bawd:
If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men
must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir
you up. Boult's returned.
Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?

BOULT:
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;
I have drawn her picture with my voice.

Bawd:
And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?

BOULT:
'Faith, they listened to me as they would have
hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to
her very description.

Bawd:
We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.

BOULT:
To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the
French knight that cowers i' the hams?

Bawd:
Who, Monsieur Veroles?

BOULT:
Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore
he would see her to-morrow.

Bawd:
Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
sun.

BOULT:
Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
should lodge them with this sign.

Bawd:

BOULT:
O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.

Bawd:
Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
with warrant.

BOULT:
'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
I have bargained for the joint,--

Bawd:
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.

BOULT:
I may so.

Bawd:
Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the
manner of your garments well.

BOULT:
Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.

Bawd:
Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou
hast the harvest out of thine own report.

BOULT:
I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.

Bawd:
Come your ways; follow me.

Bawd:
What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?

DIONYZA:
Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?

CLEON:
O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!

DIONYZA:
I think
You'll turn a child again.

CLEON:
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
To equal any single crown o' the earth
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
Whom thou hast poison'd too:
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?

DIONYZA:
That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
Unless you play the pious innocent,
And for an honest attribute cry out
'She died by foul play.'

CLEON:
O, go to. Well, well,
Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
Do like this worst.

DIONYZA:
Be one of those that think
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
And open this to Pericles. I do shame
To think of what a noble strain you are,
And of how coward a spirit.

CLEON:
To such proceeding
Who ever but his approbation added,
Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
From honourable sources.

DIONYZA:
Be it so, then:
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
She did disdain my child, and stood between
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
And though you call my course unnatural,
You not your child well loving, yet I find
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
Perform'd to your sole daughter.

CLEON:
Heavens forgive it!

DIONYZA:
And as for Pericles,
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
And yet we mourn: her monument
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
In glittering golden characters express
A general praise to her, and care in us
At whose expense 'tis done.

CLEON:
Thou art like the harpy,
Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
Seize with thine eagle's talons.

DIONYZA:
You are like one that superstitiously
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

Bawd:
Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,
if he should cheapen a kiss of her.

BOULT:
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.

Bawd:
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.

BOULT:
We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
baggage would but give way to customers.

Bawd:
Now, the gods to-bless your honour!

BOULT:
I am glad to see your honour in good health.

Bawd:
We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
came her like in Mytilene.

Bawd:
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.

BOULT:
For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--

BOULT:
O, sir, I can be modest.

Bawd:
Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never
plucked yet, I can assure you.
Is she not a fair creature?

Bawd:
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
I'll have done presently.

Bawd:

Bawd:
Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
whom I am bound to.

Bawd:
Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.

Bawd:
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.

BOULT:
I beseech your honour, one piece for me.

BOULT:
How's this? We must take another course with you.
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like
a spaniel. Come your ways.

BOULT:
I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common
hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll
have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.

Bawd:
How now! what's the matter?

BOULT:
Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy
words to the Lord Lysimachus.

Bawd:
O abominable!

BOULT:
She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
the face of the gods.

Bawd:
Marry, hang her up for ever!

BOULT:
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
snowball; saying his prayers too.

Bawd:
Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:
crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.

BOULT:
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
is, she shall be ploughed.

Bawd:
She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!

BOULT:
Come, mistress; come your ways with me.

BOULT:
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.

BOULT:
Come now, your one thing.

BOULT:
Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.

BOULT:
What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
buy him a wooden one?

BOULT:
But can you teach all this you speak of?

BOULT:
Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can
place thee, I will.

BOULT:
'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
But since my master and mistress have bought you,
there's no going but by their consent: therefore I
will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.

DIANA:
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
There, when my maiden priests are met together,
Before the people all,
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
And give them repetition to the life.
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
Awake, and tell thy dream.

CERIMON:
Noble sir,
If you have told Diana's altar true,
This is your wife.

CERIMON:
Upon this coast, I warrant you.

CERIMON:
Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
Early in blustering morn this lady was
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
Here in Diana's temple.

CERIMON:
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.

CERIMON:
I will, my lord.
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
How she came placed here in the temple;
No needful thing omitted.

BASSIANUS:
Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
Keep then this passage to the Capitol
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
To justice, continence and nobility;
But let desert in pure election shine,
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

BASSIANUS:
Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
In thy uprightness and integrity,
And so I love and honour thee and thine,
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
And to my fortunes and the people's favor
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.

BASSIANUS:
Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.

Captain:
Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.
Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
Successful in the battles that he fights,
With honour and with fortune is return'd
From where he circumscribed with his sword,
And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.

CHIRON:
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?

DEMETRIUS:
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

BASSIANUS:
Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
But honour thee, and will do till I die:
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed.

BASSIANUS:
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.

BASSIANUS:
Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
To do myself this reason and this right.

BASSIANUS:
By him that justly may
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.

All:

BASSIANUS:
And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.

BASSIANUS:
Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
But let the laws of Rome determine all;
Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.

BASSIANUS:
My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
Answer I must and shall do with my life.
Only thus much I give your grace to know:
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
That in the rescue of Lavinia
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.

AARON:
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
So Tamora:
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
To wait upon this new-made empress.
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
Holloa! what storm is this?

DEMETRIUS:
Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.

CHIRON:
Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.

AARON:

DEMETRIUS:
Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it.

CHIRON:
Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.

DEMETRIUS:
Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?

AARON:

DEMETRIUS:
Not I, till I have sheathed
My rapier in his bosom and withal
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.

CHIRON:
For that I am prepared and full resolved.
Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!

AARON:
Away, I say!
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
This petty brabble will undo us all.
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
It is to jet upon a prince's right?
What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
Or Bassianus so degenerate,
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
This discord's ground, the music would not please.

CHIRON:
I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
I love Lavinia more than all the world.

DEMETRIUS:
Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

AARON:
Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome
How furious and impatient they be,
And cannot brook competitors in love?
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
By this device.

CHIRON:
Aaron, a thousand deaths
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.

AARON:
To achieve her! how?

DEMETRIUS:
Why makest thou it so strange?
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
She is a woman, therefore may be won;
She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
What, man! more water glideth by the mill
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.

AARON:

DEMETRIUS:
Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words, fair looks and liberality?
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?

AARON:
Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
Would serve your turns.

CHIRON:
Ay, so the turn were served.

DEMETRIUS:
Aaron, thou hast hit it.

AARON:
Would you had hit it too!
Then should not we be tired with this ado.
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
To square for this? would it offend you, then
That both should speed?

CHIRON:
Faith, not me.

DEMETRIUS:
Nor me, so I were one.

AARON:
For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
That you affect; and so must you resolve,
That what you cannot as you would achieve,
You must perforce accomplish as you may.
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
A speedier course than lingering languishment
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
The forest walks are wide and spacious;
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
Single you thither then this dainty doe,
And strike her home by force, if not by words:
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
To villany and vengeance consecrate,
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
And she shall file our engines with advice,
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
But to your wishes' height advance you both.
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
your turns;
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.

CHIRON:
Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,

DEMETRIUS:
Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
Per Styga, per manes vehor.

BASSIANUS:
Lavinia, how say you?

DEMETRIUS:
Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

AARON:
He that had wit would think that I had none,
To bury so much gold under a tree,
And never after to inherit it.
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
Which, cunningly effected, will beget
A very excellent piece of villany:
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
That have their alms out of the empress' chest.

AARON:
Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
Saturn is dominator over mine:
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution?
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
Now question me no more; we are espied;
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.

AARON:
No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.

BASSIANUS:
Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
Or is it Dian, habited like her,
Who hath abandoned her holy groves
To see the general hunting in this forest?

BASSIANUS:
Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
Spotted, detested, and abominable.
Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
If foul desire had not conducted you?

BASSIANUS:
The king my brother shall have note of this.

DEMETRIUS:
How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?

DEMETRIUS:
This is a witness that I am thy son.

CHIRON:
And this for me, struck home to show my strength.

DEMETRIUS:
Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
This minion stood upon her chastity,
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
And shall she carry this unto her grave?

CHIRON:
An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.

CHIRON:
I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.

DEMETRIUS:
Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
To see her tears; but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

CHIRON:
What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?

DEMETRIUS:
Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.

CHIRON:
Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

AARON:
Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.

AARON:

AARON:
My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

DEMETRIUS:
So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.

CHIRON:
Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.

DEMETRIUS:
See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.

CHIRON:
Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.

DEMETRIUS:
She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.

CHIRON:
An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.

DEMETRIUS:
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.

AARON:
Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor
Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
And send it to the king: he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.

AARON:
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
For fear they die before their pardon come.

AARON:

AARON:
I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

CHIRON:
Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
He hath some message to deliver us.

AARON:
Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.

DEMETRIUS:
Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?

DEMETRIUS:
What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
Let's see;
'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'

CHIRON:
O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
I read it in the grammar long ago.

AARON:
Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
But were our witty empress well afoot,
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
Captives, to be advanced to this height?
It did me good, before the palace gate
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.

DEMETRIUS:
But me more good, to see so great a lord
Basely insinuate and send us gifts.

AARON:
Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?

DEMETRIUS:
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.

CHIRON:
A charitable wish and full of love.

AARON:
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.

CHIRON:
And that would she for twenty thousand more.

DEMETRIUS:
Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
For our beloved mother in her pains.

AARON:

DEMETRIUS:
Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?

CHIRON:
Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.

DEMETRIUS:
Soft! who comes here?

AARON:
Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?

AARON:
Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?

AARON:
To whom?

AARON:
Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?

AARON:
Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.

AARON:
'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.

DEMETRIUS:
Villain, what hast thou done?

AARON:
That which thou canst not undo.

CHIRON:
Thou hast undone our mother.

AARON:
Villain, I have done thy mother.

DEMETRIUS:
And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!

CHIRON:
It shall not live.

AARON:
It shall not die.

AARON:
What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
Do execution on my flesh and blood.

DEMETRIUS:
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.

AARON:
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
That touches this my first-born son and heir!
I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
Coal-black is better than another hue,
In that it scorns to bear another hue;
For all the water in the ocean
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
Tell the empress from me, I am of age
To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.

DEMETRIUS:
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?

AARON:
My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
The vigour and the picture of my youth:
This before all the world do I prefer;
This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

DEMETRIUS:
By this our mother is forever shamed.

CHIRON:
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.

CHIRON:
I blush to think upon this ignomy.

AARON:
Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
And from that womb where you imprison'd were
He is enfranchised and come to light:
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
Although my seal be stamped in his face.

DEMETRIUS:
Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.

AARON:
Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
My son and I will have the wind of you:
Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.

DEMETRIUS:
How many women saw this child of his?

AARON:
Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
But say, again; how many saw the child?

AARON:
The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.

DEMETRIUS:
What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?

AARON:
O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
And now be it known to you my full intent.
Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
His child is like to her, fair as you are:
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
And tell them both the circumstance of all;
And how by this their child shall be advanced,
And be received for the emperor's heir,
And substituted in the place of mine,
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
And you must needs bestow her funeral;
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
This done, see that you take no longer days,
But send the midwife presently to me.
The midwife and the nurse well made away,
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.

CHIRON:
Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
With secrets.

DEMETRIUS:
For this care of Tamora,
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.

AARON:
Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
To be a warrior, and command a camp.

Clown:
O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken
them down again, for the man must not be hanged till
the next week.

Clown:
Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him
in all my life.

Clown:
Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.

Clown:
From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.

Clown:
Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.

Clown:
Ay, sir.

Clown:
I warrant you, sir, let me alone.

Clown:
God be with you, sir; I will.

Clown:
Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.

Clown:
'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.

Clown:
How much money must I have?

Clown:
Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
a fair end.

AEMILIUS:
Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power
high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
They hither march amain, under conduct
Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
As much as ever Coriolanus did.

AEMILIUS:
Your bidding shall I do effectually.

All the Goths:
And as he saith, so say we all with him.

AARON:
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.

AARON:
Lucius, save the child,
And bear it from me to the empress.
If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
That highly may advantage thee to hear:
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'

AARON:
An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
And this shall all be buried by my death,
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

AARON:
Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

AARON:
What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
Yet, for I know thou art religious
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
An idiot holds his bauble for a god
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
Or else I will discover nought to thee.

AARON:
First know thou, I begot him on the empress.

AARON:
Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.

AARON:
Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.

AARON:
Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
That codding spirit had they from their mother,
As sure a card as ever won the set;
That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
As true a dog as ever fought at head.
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
I wrote the letter that thy father found
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
And, when I had it, drew myself apart
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
And when I told the empress of this sport,
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

AARON:
Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.

AARON:
Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
Few come within the compass of my curse,--
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
As kill a man, or else devise his death,
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
Set deadly enmity between two friends,
Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

AARON:
If there be devils, would I were a devil,
To live and burn in everlasting fire,
So I might have your company in hell,
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!

AEMILIUS:
Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
And, for he understands you are in arms,
He craves a parley at your father's house,
Willing you to demand your hostages,
And they shall be immediately deliver'd.

DEMETRIUS:
Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.

CHIRON:
Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
And I am sent to be revenged on him.

DEMETRIUS:
Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.

CHIRON:
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?

CHIRON:
Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.

AARON:
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!

AEMILIUS:
Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
Lucius our emperor; for well I know
The common voice do cry it shall be so.

All:
Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!

All:
Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!

AEMILIUS:
You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
That hath been breeder of these dire events.

AARON:
O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done:
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform, if I might have my will;
If one good deed in all my life I did,
I do repent it from my very soul.

BEDFORD:
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
Comets, importing change of times and states,
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
That have consented unto Henry's death!
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.

EXETER:
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
Henry is dead and never shall revive:
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
And death's dishonourable victory
We with our stately presence glorify,
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
By magic verses have contrived his end?

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector
And lookest to command the prince and realm.
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
More than God or religious churchmen may.

BEDFORD:
Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
Posterity, await for wretched years,
When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
And none but women left to wail the dead.
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright--

BEDFORD:
What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.

EXETER:
How were they lost? what treachery was used?

EXETER:
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.

BEDFORD:
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
To weep their intermissive miseries.

EXETER:
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?

BEDFORD:
Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
Wherewith already France is overrun.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?

BEDFORD:
Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
For living idly here in pomp and ease,
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.

BEDFORD:
His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.

EXETER:
Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.

BEDFORD:
I do remember it; and here take my leave,
To go about my preparation.

EXETER:
To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
Being ordain'd his special governor,
And for his safety there I'll best devise.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Each hath his place and function to attend:
I am left out; for me nothing remains.
But long I will not be Jack out of office:
The king from Eltham I intend to steal
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.

CHARLES:
Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
So in the earth, to this day is not known:
Late did he shine upon the English side;
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
What towns of any moment but we have?
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.

ALENCON:
They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
Either they must be dieted like mules
And have their provender tied to their mouths
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.

CHARLES:
Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
Him I forgive my death that killeth me
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.

CHARLES:
Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,
But that they left me 'midst my enemies.

ALENCON:
Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
During the time Edward the Third did reign.
More truly now may this be verified;
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
They had such courage and audacity?

CHARLES:
Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.

ALENCON:
Be it so.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.

CHARLES:
Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
What's past and what's to come she can descry.
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
For they are certain and unfallible.

CHARLES:
Go, call her in.
But first, to try her skill,
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

CHARLES:
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.

CHARLES:
Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.

CHARLES:
Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.

CHARLES:
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.

CHARLES:
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.

ALENCON:
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.

ALENCON:
He may mean more than we poor men do know:
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.

CHARLES:
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.

CHARLES:
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
How may I reverently worship thee enough?

ALENCON:
Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.

CHARLES:
Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:
No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
I do, thou most usurping proditor,
And not protector, of the king or realm.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
One that still motions war and never peace,
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
That seeks to overthrow religion,
Because he is protector of the realm,
And would have armour here out of the Tower,
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;
For I intend to have it ere long.

Boy:
Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.

Boy:
Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.

CHARLES:
Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,
How shall I honour thee for this success?
Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.

ALENCON:
All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.

CHARLES:
'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
For which I will divide my crown with her,
And all the priests and friars in my realm
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
In memory of her when she is dead,
Her ashes, in an urn more precious
Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,
Transported shall be at high festivals
Before the kings and queens of France.
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
Come in, and let us banquet royally,
After this golden day of victory.

BEDFORD:
Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,
Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,
To join with witches and the help of hell!

BURGUNDY:
Traitors have never other company.
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?

BEDFORD:
A maid! and be so martial!

BURGUNDY:
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
If underneath the standard of the French
She carry armour as she hath begun.

BEDFORD:
Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.

BEDFORD:
Agreed: I'll to yond corner.

BURGUNDY:
And I to this.

ALENCON:
How now, my lords! what, all unready so?

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.

ALENCON:
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
More venturous or desperate than this.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.

ALENCON:
Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.

CHARLES:
Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
Make us partakers of a little gain,
That now our loss might be ten times so much?

CHARLES:
Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
That, being captain of the watch to-night,
Did look no better to that weighty charge.

ALENCON:
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government,
We had not been thus shamefully surprised.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Mine was secure.

CHARLES:
And, for myself, most part of all this night,
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
I was employ'd in passing to and fro,
About relieving of the sentinels:
Then how or which way should they first break in?

BEDFORD:
The day begins to break, and night is fled,
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.

BEDFORD:
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
They did amongst the troops of armed men
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.

BURGUNDY:
Myself, as far as I could well discern
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
That could not live asunder day or night.
After that things are set in order here,
We'll follow them with all the power we have.

BURGUNDY:
Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.

BEDFORD:
No, truly; it is more than manners will:
And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
Are often welcomest when they are gone.

Captain:
I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Porter, remember what I gave in charge;
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,
I shall as famous be by this exploit
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
And his achievements of no less account:
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
To give their censure of these rare reports.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false:
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
To me, blood-thirsty lord;
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
But now the substance shall endure the like,
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country, slain our citizens
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Why, art not thou the man?

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Then have I substance too.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
He will be here, and yet he is not here:
How can these contrarieties agree?

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art.

COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE:
With all my heart, and think me honoured
To feast so great a warrior in my house.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,
With written pamphlets studiously devised,
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
Do it without invention, suddenly;
As I with sudden and extemporal speech
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
To give me hearing what I shall reply.
If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,
As he will have me, how am I so poor?
Or how haps it I seek not to advance
Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
And for dissension, who preferreth peace
More than I do?--except I be provoked.
No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
It is, because no one should sway but he;
No one but he should be about the king;
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth.
But he shall know I am as good--

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
But one imperious in another's throne?

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
And am not I a prelate of the church?

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Unreverent Gloster!

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Rome shall remedy this.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
He shall submit, or I will never yield.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.

ALL:
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!

EXETER:
Ay, we may march in England or in France,
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
And will at last break out into a flame:
As fester'd members rot but by degree,
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
So will this base and envious discord breed.
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
His days may finish ere that hapless time.

CHARLES:
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;
Now she is there, how will she specify
Where is the best and safest passage in?

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
The burning torch in yonder turret stands.

CHARLES:
Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!

BURGUNDY:
Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.

CHARLES:
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.

BEDFORD:
O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!

ALENCON:
Signior, no.

BURGUNDY:
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.

BEDFORD:
Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
And will be partner of your weal or woe.

BURGUNDY:
Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.

BEDFORD:
Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
Because I ever found them as myself.

Captain:
Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?

FASTOLFE:
Whither away! to save myself by flight:
We are like to have the overthrow again.

Captain:
What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?

FASTOLFE:
Ay,
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!

Captain:
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!

BEDFORD:
Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.

BURGUNDY:
Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.

BURGUNDY:
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.

CHARLES:
We have been guided by thee hitherto,
And of thy cunning had no diffidence:
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Search out thy wit for secret policies,
And we will make thee famous through the world.

ALENCON:
We'll set thy statue in some holy place,
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.

CHARLES:
Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
France were no place for Henry's warriors;
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
But be extirped from our provinces.

ALENCON:
For ever should they be expulsed from France
And not have title of an earldom here.

CHARLES:
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!

BURGUNDY:
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?

BURGUNDY:
What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.

CHARLES:
Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.

BURGUNDY:
Speak on; but be not over-tedious.

BURGUNDY:
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.

BURGUNDY:
I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
And made me almost yield upon my knees.
Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:
My forces and my power of men are yours:
So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.

CHARLES:
Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.

ALENCON:
Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.

CHARLES:
Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.

BASSET:
Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage
The envious barking of your saucy tongue
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.

BASSET:
Why, what is he? as good a man as York.

BASSET:
Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.

BISHOP OF WINCHESTER:
God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!

FASTOLFE:
My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
To haste unto your coronation,
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.

BASSET:
And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.

BASSET:
And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.

BASSET:
Crossing the sea from England into France,
This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
About a certain question in the law
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;
With other vile and ignominious terms:
In confutation of which rude reproach
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
I crave the benefit of law of arms.

BASSET:
Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.

EXETER:
It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.

EXETER:
Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
This jarring discord of nobility,
This shouldering of each other in the court,
This factious bandying of their favourites,
But that it doth presage some ill event.
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
But more when envy breeds unkind division;
There comes the rain, there begins confusion.

Captain:
Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.

CHARLES:
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
We should have found a bloody day of this.

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!

BURGUNDY:
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!

BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder
Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.

CHARLES:
O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled
During the life, let us not wrong it dead.

CHARLES:
On what submissive message art thou sent?

CHARLES:
For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.
But tell me whom thou seek'st.

CHARLES:
Go, take their bodies hence.

CHARLES:
So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.
And now to Paris, in this conquering vein:
All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.

EXETER:
What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
Then I perceive that will be verified
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,
'If once he come to be a cardinal,
He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'

CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER:
Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
The sum of money which I promised
Should be deliver'd to his holiness
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.

CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER:

CHARLES:
These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
And turn again unto the warlike French.

ALENCON:
Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.

CHARLES:
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak.

CHARLES:
Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
But we will presently provide for them.

BURGUNDY:
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:
Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.

CHARLES:
Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!

CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER:
Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
With letters of commission from the king.
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
Have earnestly implored a general peace
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
Approacheth, to confer about some matter.

CHARLES:
Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
We come to be informed by yourselves
What the conditions of that league must be.

CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER:
Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
Of mere compassion and of lenity,
To ease your country of distressful war,
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
To pay him tribute, submit thyself,
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.

ALENCON:
Must he be then as shadow of himself?
Adorn his temples with a coronet,
And yet, in substance and authority,
Retain but privilege of a private man?
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.

CHARLES:
'Tis known already that I am possess'd
With more than half the Gallian territories,
And therein reverenced for their lawful king:
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
Detract so much from that prerogative,
As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
That which I have than, coveting for more,
Be cast from possibility of all.

ALENCON:
To say the truth, it is your policy
To save your subjects from such massacre
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
By our proceeding in hostility;
And therefore take this compact of a truce,
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.

CHARLES:
It shall;
Only reserved, you claim no interest
In any of our towns of garrison.

EXETER:
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.

CAESAR:
Calpurnia!

CASCA:
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

CAESAR:
Calpurnia!

CALPURNIA:
Here, my lord.

CAESAR:
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
When he doth run his course. Antonius!

ANTONY:
Caesar, my lord?

CAESAR:
Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.

ANTONY:
I shall remember:
When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.

CAESAR:
Set on; and leave no ceremony out.

CAESAR:
Ha! who calls?

CASCA:
Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!

CAESAR:
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.

CAESAR:
What man is that?

BRUTUS:
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

CAESAR:
Set him before me; let me see his face.

CASSIUS:
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.

CAESAR:
What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.

CAESAR:
He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.

CASSIUS:
Will you go see the order of the course?

BRUTUS:
Not I.

CASSIUS:
I pray you, do.

BRUTUS:
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.

CASSIUS:
Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.

BRUTUS:
Cassius,
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.

CASSIUS:
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

BRUTUS:
No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.

CASSIUS:
'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

BRUTUS:
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?

CASSIUS:
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

BRUTUS:
What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Caesar for their king.

CASSIUS:
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.

BRUTUS:
I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently,
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death.

CASSIUS:
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.

BRUTUS:
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.

CASSIUS:
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.

BRUTUS:
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.

CASSIUS:
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

BRUTUS:
The games are done and Caesar is returning.

CASSIUS:
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.

BRUTUS:
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.

CASSIUS:
Casca will tell us what the matter is.

CAESAR:
Antonius!

ANTONY:
Caesar?

CAESAR:
Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.

ANTONY:
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.

CAESAR:
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

CASCA:
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

BRUTUS:
Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
That Caesar looks so sad.

CASCA:
Why, you were with him, were you not?

BRUTUS:
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

CASCA:
Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.

BRUTUS:
What was the second noise for?

CASCA:
Why, for that too.

CASSIUS:
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?

CASCA:
Why, for that too.

BRUTUS:
Was the crown offered him thrice?

CASCA:
Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
mine honest neighbours shouted.

CASSIUS:
Who offered him the crown?

CASCA:
Why, Antony.

BRUTUS:
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

CASCA:
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.

CASSIUS:
But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?

CASCA:
He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
mouth, and was speechless.

BRUTUS:
'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.

CASSIUS:
No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

CASCA:
I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
the theatre, I am no true man.

BRUTUS:
What said he when he came unto himself?

CASCA:
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.

BRUTUS:
And after that, he came, thus sad, away?

CASCA:
Ay.

CASSIUS:
Did Cicero say any thing?

CASCA:
Ay, he spoke Greek.

CASSIUS:
To what effect?

CASCA:
Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
remember it.

CASSIUS:
Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?

CASCA:
No, I am promised forth.

CASSIUS:
Will you dine with me to-morrow?

CASCA:
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating.

CASSIUS:
Good: I will expect you.

CASCA:
Do so. Farewell, both.

BRUTUS:
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.

CASSIUS:
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.

BRUTUS:
And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

CASSIUS:
I will do so: till then, think of the world.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humour me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

CICERO:
Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?

CASCA:
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
But never till to-night, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.

CICERO:
Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?

CASCA:
A common slave--you know him well by sight--
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
For, I believe, they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.

CICERO:
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?

CASCA:
He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.

CICERO:
Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.

CASCA:
Farewell, Cicero.

CASSIUS:
Who's there?

CASCA:
A Roman.

CASSIUS:
Casca, by your voice.

CASCA:
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!

CASSIUS:
A very pleasing night to honest men.

CASCA:
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

CASSIUS:
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.

CASCA:
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

CASSIUS:
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men fool and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

CASCA:
'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?

CASSIUS:
Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

CASCA:
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
In every place, save here in Italy.

CASSIUS:
I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.

CASCA:
So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.

CASSIUS:
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.

CASCA:
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.

CASSIUS:
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
And the complexion of the element
In favour's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

CASCA:
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

CASSIUS:
'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.
Cinna, where haste you so?

CINNA:
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

CASSIUS:
No, it is Casca; one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

CINNA:
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.

CASSIUS:
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.

CINNA:
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party--

CASSIUS:
Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

CINNA:
All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

CASSIUS:
That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

CASCA:
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
And that which would appear offence in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.

CASSIUS:
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight; and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.

BRUTUS:
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!

BRUTUS:
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

BRUTUS:
It must be by his death: and for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round.
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities:
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.

BRUTUS:
Get you to bed again; it is not day.
Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?

BRUTUS:
Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

BRUTUS:
The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.
'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

BRUTUS:
'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
The Genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council; and the state of man,
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.

BRUTUS:
Is he alone?

BRUTUS:
Do you know them?

BRUTUS:
Let 'em enter.
They are the faction. O conspiracy,
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
When evils are most free? O, then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
Hide it in smiles and affability:
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention.

CASSIUS:
I think we are too bold upon your rest:
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?

BRUTUS:
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?

CASSIUS:
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
But honours you; and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.

BRUTUS:
He is welcome hither.

CASSIUS:
This, Decius Brutus.

BRUTUS:
He is welcome too.

CASSIUS:
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

BRUTUS:
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?

CASSIUS:
Shall I entreat a word?

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?

CASCA:
No.

CINNA:
O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.

CASCA:
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
Which is a great way growing on the south,
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire; and the high east
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.

BRUTUS:
Give me your hands all over, one by one.

CASSIUS:
And let us swear our resolution.

BRUTUS:
No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? what other bond
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

CASSIUS:
But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.

CASCA:
Let us not leave him out.

CINNA:
No, by no means.

BRUTUS:
O, name him not: let us not break with him;
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin.

CASSIUS:
Then leave him out.

CASCA:
Indeed he is not fit.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?

CASSIUS:
Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.

BRUTUS:
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.

CASSIUS:
Yet I fear him;
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--

BRUTUS:
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
And that were much he should; for he is given
To sports, to wildness and much company.

BRUTUS:
Peace! count the clock.

CASSIUS:
The clock hath stricken three.

CASSIUS:
But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humour the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.

CASSIUS:
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

BRUTUS:
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?

CINNA:
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

BRUTUS:
Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

CASSIUS:
The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.

BRUTUS:
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
With untired spirits and formal constancy:
And so good morrow to you every one.
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

BRUTUS:
Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

BRUTUS:
I am not well in health, and that is all.

BRUTUS:
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

BRUTUS:
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

BRUTUS:
You are my true and honourable wife,
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart

BRUTUS:
O ye gods,
Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
All the charactery of my sad brows:
Leave me with haste.
Lucius, who's that knocks?

BRUTUS:
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?

BRUTUS:
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

BRUTUS:
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

BRUTUS:
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

BRUTUS:
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
To whom it must be done.

BRUTUS:
Follow me, then.

CAESAR:
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?

CAESAR:
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success.

CALPURNIA:
What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.

CAESAR:
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.

CALPURNIA:
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.

CAESAR:
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.

CALPURNIA:
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

CAESAR:
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
What say the augurers?

CAESAR:
The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible:
And Caesar shall go forth.

CALPURNIA:
Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

CAESAR:
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.

CAESAR:
And you are come in very happy time,
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.

CALPURNIA:
Say he is sick.

CAESAR:
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

CAESAR:
The cause is in my will: I will not come;
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know:
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
And evils imminent; and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

CAESAR:
And this way have you well expounded it.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
I have, when you have heard what I can say:
And know it now: the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
'Break up the senate till another time,
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
And reason to my love is liable.

CAESAR:
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

CAESAR:
Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is 't o'clock?

BRUTUS:
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

CAESAR:
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.

ANTONY:
So to most noble Caesar.

CAESAR:
Bid them prepare within:
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me to-day:
Be near me, that I may remember you.

CAESAR:
Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.

BRUTUS:

ARTEMIDORUS:
'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
'ARTEMIDORUS.'
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

CAESAR:

ARTEMIDORUS:
Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.

ARTEMIDORUS:
O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.

CAESAR:
What touches us ourself shall be last served.

ARTEMIDORUS:
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.

CAESAR:
What, is the fellow mad?

CASSIUS:
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.

CASSIUS:
What enterprise, Popilius?

BRUTUS:
What said Popilius Lena?

CASSIUS:
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.

BRUTUS:
Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.

CASSIUS:
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.

BRUTUS:
Cassius, be constant:
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

CASSIUS:
Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

BRUTUS:
He is address'd: press near and second him.

CINNA:
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

CAESAR:
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Caesar and his senate must redress?

CAESAR:
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.

BRUTUS:
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

CAESAR:
What, Brutus!

CASSIUS:
Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

CASSIUS:
I could be well moved, if I were as you:
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
And constant do remain to keep him so.

CINNA:
O Caesar,--

CAESAR:
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?

DECIUS BRUTUS:
Great Caesar,--

CAESAR:
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

CASCA:
Speak, hands for me!

CAESAR:
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.

CINNA:
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

CASSIUS:
Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'

BRUTUS:
People and senators, be not affrighted;
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.

CASCA:
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
And Cassius too.

BRUTUS:
Where's Publius?

CINNA:
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

BRUTUS:
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
There is no harm intended to your person,
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.

CASSIUS:
And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.

BRUTUS:
Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
But we the doers.

CASSIUS:
Where is Antony?

BRUTUS:
Fates, we will know your pleasures:
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.

CASSIUS:
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

BRUTUS:
Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'

CASSIUS:
Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

BRUTUS:
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!

CASSIUS:
So oft as that shall be,
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
The men that gave their country liberty.

DECIUS BRUTUS:
What, shall we forth?

CASSIUS:
Ay, every man away:
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

BRUTUS:
Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.

BRUTUS:
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
Depart untouch'd.

BRUTUS:
I know that we shall have him well to friend.

CASSIUS:
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
That fears him much; and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

BRUTUS:
But here comes Antony.
Welcome, Mark Antony.

ANTONY:
O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die:
No place will please me so, no mean of death,
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.

BRUTUS:
O Antony, beg not your death of us.
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
As, by our hands and this our present act,
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done:
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

CASSIUS:
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.

BRUTUS:
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause,
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.

ANTONY:
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand:
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
Dost thou here lie!

CASSIUS:
Mark Antony,--

ANTONY:
Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

CASSIUS:
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

ANTONY:
Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

BRUTUS:
Or else were this a savage spectacle:
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
You should be satisfied.

ANTONY:
That's all I seek:
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the market-place;
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Speak in the order of his funeral.

BRUTUS:
You shall, Mark Antony.

CASSIUS:
Brutus, a word with you.
You know not what you do: do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral:
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?

BRUTUS:
By your pardon;
I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission,
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

CASSIUS:
I know not what may fall; I like it not.

BRUTUS:
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do't by our permission;
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral: and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.

ANTONY:
Be it so.
I do desire no more.

BRUTUS:
Prepare the body then, and follow us.

ANTONY:
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

ANTONY:
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

ANTONY:
Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?

ANTONY:
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the market-place: there shall I try
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men;
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.

Citizens:
We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.

BRUTUS:
Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street,
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.

BRUTUS:
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

All:
None, Brutus, none.

BRUTUS:
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.

All:
Live, Brutus! live, live!

BRUTUS:
My countrymen,--

BRUTUS:
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.

ANTONY:
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.

ANTONY:
You gentle Romans,--

Citizens:
Peace, ho! let us hear him.

ANTONY:
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.

ANTONY:
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.

All:
The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.

ANTONY:
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!

ANTONY:
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

All:
The will! the testament!

ANTONY:
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?

ANTONY:
Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

ANTONY:
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

All:
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!

ANTONY:
Stay, countrymen.

ANTONY:
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

All:
We'll mutiny.

ANTONY:
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

All:
Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!

ANTONY:
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
You have forgot the will I told you of.

All:
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.

ANTONY:
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

ANTONY:
Hear me with patience.

All:
Peace, ho!

ANTONY:
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?

ANTONY:
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt!
How now, fellow!

ANTONY:
Where is he?

ANTONY:
And thither will I straight to visit him:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
And in this mood will give us any thing.

ANTONY:
Belike they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

CINNA THE POET:
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.

CINNA THE POET:
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

CINNA THE POET:
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.

CINNA THE POET:
As a friend.

CINNA THE POET:
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

CINNA THE POET:
Truly, my name is Cinna.

CINNA THE POET:
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.

CINNA THE POET:
I am not Cinna the conspirator.

ANTONY:
These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.

ANTONY:
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.

ANTONY:
This is a slight unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?

ANTONY:
Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
And though we lay these honours on this man,
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
And graze in commons.

ANTONY:
So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
I do appoint him store of provender:
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
On abjects, orts and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.

BRUTUS:
Stand, ho!

BRUTUS:
What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?

BRUTUS:
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.

BRUTUS:
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
How he received you, let me be resolved.

BRUTUS:
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay,
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

BRUTUS:
Hark! he is arrived.
March gently on to meet him.

CASSIUS:
Stand, ho!

BRUTUS:
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.

CASSIUS:
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

BRUTUS:
Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

CASSIUS:
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
And when you do them--

BRUTUS:
Cassius, be content.
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.

CASSIUS:
Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.

BRUTUS:
Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

CASSIUS:
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.

BRUTUS:
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.

CASSIUS:
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.

BRUTUS:
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.

CASSIUS:
I an itching palm!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

BRUTUS:
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

CASSIUS:
Chastisement!

BRUTUS:
Remember March, the ides of March remember:
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.

CASSIUS:
Brutus, bay not me;
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Older in practise, abler than yourself
To make conditions.

BRUTUS:
Go to; you are not, Cassius.

CASSIUS:
I am.

BRUTUS:
I say you are not.

CASSIUS:
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.

BRUTUS:
Away, slight man!

CASSIUS:
Is't possible?

BRUTUS:
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

CASSIUS:
O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?

BRUTUS:
All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.

CASSIUS:
Is it come to this?

BRUTUS:
You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

CASSIUS:
You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
Did I say 'better'?

BRUTUS:
If you did, I care not.

CASSIUS:
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

BRUTUS:
Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.

CASSIUS:
I durst not!

BRUTUS:
No.

CASSIUS:
What, durst not tempt him!

BRUTUS:
For your life you durst not!

CASSIUS:
Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

BRUTUS:
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
Dash him to pieces!

CASSIUS:
I denied you not.

BRUTUS:
You did.

CASSIUS:
I did not: he was but a fool that brought
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

BRUTUS:
I do not, till you practise them on me.

CASSIUS:
You love me not.

BRUTUS:
I do not like your faults.

CASSIUS:
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

BRUTUS:
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.

CASSIUS:
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world;
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

BRUTUS:
Sheathe your dagger:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.

CASSIUS:
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?

BRUTUS:
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

CASSIUS:
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

BRUTUS:
And my heart too.

CASSIUS:
O Brutus!

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

CASSIUS:
Have not you love enough to bear with me,
When that rash humour which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful?

BRUTUS:
Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

CASSIUS:
How now! what's the matter?

CASSIUS:
Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

BRUTUS:
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

CASSIUS:
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

BRUTUS:
I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!

CASSIUS:
Away, away, be gone.

BRUTUS:
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.

CASSIUS:
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.

BRUTUS:
Lucius, a bowl of wine!

CASSIUS:
I did not think you could have been so angry.

BRUTUS:
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

CASSIUS:
Of your philosophy you make no use,
If you give place to accidental evils.

BRUTUS:
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

CASSIUS:
Ha! Portia!

BRUTUS:
She is dead.

CASSIUS:
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?

BRUTUS:
Impatient of my absence,
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.

CASSIUS:
And died so?

BRUTUS:
Even so.

CASSIUS:
O ye immortal gods!

BRUTUS:
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

CASSIUS:
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.

BRUTUS:
Come in, Titinius!
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,
And call in question our necessities.

CASSIUS:
Portia, art thou gone?

BRUTUS:
No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters,
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

BRUTUS:
With what addition?

BRUTUS:
Therein our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

CASSIUS:
Cicero one!

BRUTUS:
No, Messala.

BRUTUS:
Nothing, Messala.

BRUTUS:
Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?

BRUTUS:
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

BRUTUS:
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
With meditating that she must die once,
I have the patience to endure it now.

CASSIUS:
I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.

BRUTUS:
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?

CASSIUS:
I do not think it good.

BRUTUS:
Your reason?

CASSIUS:
This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

BRUTUS:
Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection;
For they have grudged us contribution:
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.

CASSIUS:
Hear me, good brother.

BRUTUS:
Under your pardon. You must note beside,
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.

CASSIUS:
Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.

BRUTUS:
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity;
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?

CASSIUS:
No more. Good night:
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.

BRUTUS:
Lucius!
My gown.
Farewell, good Messala:
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
Good night, and good repose.

CASSIUS:
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.

BRUTUS:
Every thing is well.

CASSIUS:
Good night, my lord.

BRUTUS:
Good night, good brother.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, every one.
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

BRUTUS:
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
Call Claudius and some other of my men:
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

BRUTUS:
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.

BRUTUS:
I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

BRUTUS:
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

BRUTUS:
It does, my boy:
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

BRUTUS:
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

BRUTUS:
It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
I will be good to thee.
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.

BRUTUS:
Why comest thou?

BRUTUS:
Well; then I shall see thee again?

BRUTUS:
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!

BRUTUS:
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!

BRUTUS:
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

BRUTUS:
Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?

BRUTUS:
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
Fellow thou, awake!

CLAUDIUS:
My lord?

BRUTUS:
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

BRUTUS:
Ay: saw you any thing?

CLAUDIUS:
Nor I, my lord.

BRUTUS:
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
And we will follow.

ANTONY:
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
To visit other places; and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.

ANTONY:
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.

ANTONY:
Why do you cross me in this exigent?

BRUTUS:
They stand, and would have parley.

CASSIUS:
Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.

ANTONY:
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth; the generals would have some words.

BRUTUS:
Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?

BRUTUS:
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

ANTONY:
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'

CASSIUS:
Antony,
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless.

ANTONY:
Not stingless too.

BRUTUS:
O, yes, and soundless too;
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting.

ANTONY:
Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!

CASSIUS:
Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
This tongue had not offended so to-day,
If Cassius might have ruled.

BRUTUS:
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.

BRUTUS:
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.

CASSIUS:
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!

ANTONY:
Old Cassius still!

CASSIUS:
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

BRUTUS:
Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.

CASSIUS:
Messala!

CASSIUS:
Messala,
This is my birth-day; as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
Be thou my witness that against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

CASSIUS:
I but believe it partly;
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.

BRUTUS:
Even so, Lucilius.

CASSIUS:
Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together:
What are you then determined to do?

BRUTUS:
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life: arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.

CASSIUS:
Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?

BRUTUS:
No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then, this parting was well made.

CASSIUS:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

BRUTUS:
Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

BRUTUS:
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.

CASSIUS:
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
This ensign here of mine was turning back;
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

CASSIUS:
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

CASSIUS:
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
And here again; that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

CASSIUS:
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?

CASSIUS:
What news?

CASSIUS:
Come down, behold no more.
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
Come hither, sirrah:
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
Guide thou the sword.
Caesar, thou art revenged,
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.

BRUTUS:
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

BRUTUS:
Titinius' face is upward.

CATO:
He is slain.

BRUTUS:
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails.

CATO:
Brave Titinius!
Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!

BRUTUS:
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.

BRUTUS:
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

CATO:
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

BRUTUS:
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!

ANTONY:
Where is he?

ANTONY:
This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How every thing is chanced.

BRUTUS:
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

CLITUS:
Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.

BRUTUS:
Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.

CLITUS:
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.

BRUTUS:
Peace then! no words.

CLITUS:
I'll rather kill myself.

BRUTUS:
Hark thee, Dardanius.

DARDANIUS:
Shall I do such a deed?

CLITUS:
O Dardanius!

DARDANIUS:
O Clitus!

CLITUS:
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

DARDANIUS:
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.

CLITUS:
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes.

BRUTUS:
Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.

BRUTUS:
Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
I know my hour is come.

BRUTUS:
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.

CLITUS:
Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.

BRUTUS:
Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.

CLITUS:
Fly, my lord, fly.

BRUTUS:
Hence! I will follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

BRUTUS:
Farewell, good Strato.
Caesar, now be still:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

ANTONY:
This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'

COUNTESS:
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM:
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

COUNTESS:
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

COUNTESS:
This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far, would have made nature immortal, and death
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
the death of the king's disease.

COUNTESS:
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

BERTRAM:
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

BERTRAM:
I heard not of it before.

COUNTESS:
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises; her dispositions she
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
traitors too; in her they are the better for their
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

COUNTESS:
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it.

COUNTESS:
If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
makes it soon mortal.

BERTRAM:
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

COUNTESS:
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

COUNTESS:
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

BERTRAM:

BERTRAM:
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

BERTRAM:
His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.

BERTRAM:
Some six months since, my lord.

BERTRAM:
Thank your majesty.

COUNTESS:
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

COUNTESS:
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
enough to make such knaveries yours.

Clown:
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

COUNTESS:
Well, sir.

Clown:
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
the woman and I will do as we may.

COUNTESS:
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

Clown:
I do beg your good will in this case.

COUNTESS:
In what case?

Clown:
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
heritage: and I think I shall never have the
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
they say barnes are blessings.

COUNTESS:
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

Clown:
My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

COUNTESS:
Is this all your worship's reason?

Clown:
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
are.

COUNTESS:
May the world know them?

Clown:
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
that I may repent.

COUNTESS:
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

Clown:
I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
friends for my wife's sake.

COUNTESS:
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

Clown:
You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
horns together, like any deer i' the herd.

COUNTESS:
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?

Clown:
A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
way:
For I the ballad will repeat,
Which men full true shall find;
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Your cuckoo sings by kind.

COUNTESS:
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

COUNTESS:
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
Helen, I mean.

Clown:
Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Fond done, done fond,
Was this King Priam's joy?
With that she sighed as she stood,
With that she sighed as she stood,
And gave this sentence then;
Among nine bad if one be good,
Among nine bad if one be good,
There's yet one good in ten.

COUNTESS:
What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.

Clown:
One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
might have a good woman born but one every blazing
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
one.

COUNTESS:
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

Clown:
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

COUNTESS:
Well, now.

COUNTESS:
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
make title to as much love as she finds: there is
more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
her than she'll demand.

COUNTESS:
You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
Even so it was with me when I was young:
If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
By our remembrances of days foregone,
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

COUNTESS:
You know, Helen,
I am a mother to you.

COUNTESS:
Nay, a mother:
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
Yet I express to you a mother's care:
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
Why? that you are my daughter?

COUNTESS:
I say, I am your mother.

COUNTESS:
Nor I your mother?

COUNTESS:
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
The mystery of your loneliness, and find
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
You love my son; invention is ashamed,
Against the proclamation of thy passion,
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
That in their kind they speak it: only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
Tell me truly.

COUNTESS:
Do you love my son?

COUNTESS:
Love you my son?

COUNTESS:
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
The state of your affection; for your passions
Have to the full appeach'd.

COUNTESS:
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
To go to Paris?

COUNTESS:
Wherefore? tell true.

COUNTESS:
This was your motive
For Paris, was it? speak.

COUNTESS:
But think you, Helen,
If you should tender your supposed aid,
He would receive it? he and his physicians
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
The danger to itself?

COUNTESS:
Dost thou believe't?

COUNTESS:
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

Both:
Our hearts receive your warnings.

BERTRAM:
I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

BERTRAM:
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

BERTRAM:
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

BERTRAM:
Stay: the king.

BERTRAM:
And I will do so.

COUNTESS:
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
your breeding.

Clown:
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
know my business is but to the court.

COUNTESS:
To the court! why, what place make you special,
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clown:
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
men.

COUNTESS:
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
questions.

Clown:
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
buttock, or any buttock.

COUNTESS:
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clown:
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

COUNTESS:
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
questions?

Clown:
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
will fit any question.

COUNTESS:
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands.

Clown:
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS:
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clown:
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
more, a hundred of them.

COUNTESS:
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clown:
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

COUNTESS:
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clown:
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS:
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clown:
O Lord, sir! spare not me.

COUNTESS:
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

Clown:
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

COUNTESS:
I play the noble housewife with the time
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

Clown:
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

COUNTESS:
An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back:
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
This is not much.

Clown:
Not much commendation to them.

COUNTESS:
Not much employment for you: you understand me?

Clown:
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

COUNTESS:
Haste you again.

BERTRAM:
And so 'tis.

All:
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

BERTRAM:
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.

BERTRAM:
Yes, my good lord;
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

BERTRAM:
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!

BERTRAM:
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

BERTRAM:
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.

BERTRAM:
I take her hand.

BERTRAM:
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

BERTRAM:
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
I will not bed her.

BERTRAM:
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

BERTRAM:
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
I know not yet.

BERTRAM:
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
That which I durst not speak; his present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.

BERTRAM:
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

Clown:
She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
world; but yet she is not well.

Clown:
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

Clown:
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
God send her quickly!

Clown:
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
I would she did as you say.

Clown:
Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
is within a very little of nothing.

Clown:
You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
been truth, sir.

Clown:
Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
and much fool may you find in you, even to the
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

BERTRAM:
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

BERTRAM:
And by other warranted testimony.

BERTRAM:
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
knowledge and accordingly valiant.

BERTRAM:

BERTRAM:
Will she away to-night?

BERTRAM:
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.

BERTRAM:
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

BERTRAM:
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

BERTRAM:
I think so.

BERTRAM:
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

BERTRAM:
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepared I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
That presently you take our way for home;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not. This to my mother:
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
I leave you to your wisdom.

BERTRAM:
Come, come, no more of that.

BERTRAM:
Let that go:
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

BERTRAM:
Well, what would you say?

BERTRAM:
What would you have?

BERTRAM:
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

BERTRAM:
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.
Go thou toward home; where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.

DUKE:
So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.

DUKE:
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

DUKE:
Be it his pleasure.

DUKE:
Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell:
To-morrow to the field.

COUNTESS:
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
that he comes not along with her.

Clown:
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.

COUNTESS:
By what observance, I pray you?

Clown:
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

COUNTESS:
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

Clown:
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

COUNTESS:
What have we here?

Clown:
E'en that you have there.

COUNTESS:

Clown:
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
soldiers and my young lady!

COUNTESS:
What is the matter?

Clown:
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
thought he would.

COUNTESS:
Why should he be killed?

Clown:
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
men, though it be the getting of children. Here
they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
hear your son was run away.

COUNTESS:
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

COUNTESS:
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

COUNTESS:
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

COUNTESS:
And to be a soldier?

COUNTESS:
Return you thither?

COUNTESS:
Find you that there?

COUNTESS:
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

COUNTESS:
Parolles, was it not?

COUNTESS:
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.

COUNTESS:
You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.

COUNTESS:
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!

DUKE:
The general of our horse thou art; and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.

BERTRAM:
Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To the extreme edge of hazard.

DUKE:
Then go thou forth;
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!

BERTRAM:
This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

COUNTESS:
Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
Might you not know she would do as she has done,
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

COUNTESS:
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented.

COUNTESS:
What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife;
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love: which of them both
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
To make distinction: provide this messenger:
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

DIANA:
They say the French count has done most honourable service.

DIANA:
You shall not need to fear me.

DIANA:
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

DIANA:
Whatsome'er he is,
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
Against his liking: think you it is so?

DIANA:
There is a gentleman that serves the count
Reports but coarsely of her.

DIANA:
Monsieur Parolles.

DIANA:
Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord.

DIANA:
He;
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

DIANA:
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
I would Poison that vile rascal.

DIANA:
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

BOTH:
We'll take your offer kindly.

BERTRAM:
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

BERTRAM:
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

BERTRAM:
How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
disposition.

BERTRAM:
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
not to be recovered.

BERTRAM:
It might; but it is not now.

BERTRAM:
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness.

BERTRAM:
But you must not now slumber in it.

BERTRAM:
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

BERTRAM:
I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

BERTRAM:
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

BERTRAM:
Your brother he shall go along with me.

BERTRAM:
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
The lass I spoke of.

BERTRAM:
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
Will you go see her?

All:
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.

BERTRAM:
They told me that your name was Fontibell.

DIANA:
No, my good lord, Diana.

BERTRAM:
Titled goddess;
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
You are no maiden, but a monument:
When you are dead, you should be such a one
As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.

DIANA:
She then was honest.

BERTRAM:
So should you be.

DIANA:
No:
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
As you owe to your wife.

BERTRAM:
No more o' that;
I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service.

DIANA:
Ay, so you serve us
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
And mock us with our bareness.

BERTRAM:
How have I sworn!

DIANA:
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
If I should swear by God's great attributes,
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
To swear by him whom I protest to love,
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
At least in my opinion.

BERTRAM:
Change it, change it;
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever.

DIANA:
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

BERTRAM:
I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
To give it from me.

DIANA:
Will you not, my lord?

BERTRAM:
It is an honour 'longing to our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose.

DIANA:
Mine honour's such a ring:
My chastity's the jewel of our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
Against your vain assault.

BERTRAM:
Here, take my ring:
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
And I'll be bid by thee.

DIANA:
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

BERTRAM:
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

DIANA:
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end.
My mother told me just how he would woo,
As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win.

BERTRAM:
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
that I have not ended yet.

BERTRAM:
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

BERTRAM:
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

BERTRAM:
Nothing of me, has a'?

BERTRAM:
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
me: hush, hush!

BERTRAM:
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

BERTRAM:
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
delivers it.

BERTRAM:
What shall be done to him?

BERTRAM:
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

BERTRAM:
Our interpreter does it well.

BERTRAM:
Damnable both-sides rogue!

BERTRAM:
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
in's forehead.

BERTRAM:
I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
he's a cat to me.

BERTRAM:
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
him for me, he's more and more a cat.

BERTRAM:
A pox on him, he's a cat still.

BERTRAM:
Good morrow, noble captain.

DIANA:
Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

COUNTESS:
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
could not have owed her a more rooted love.

Clown:
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

Clown:
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
skill in grass.

Clown:
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

Clown:
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

Clown:
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

Clown:
At your service.

Clown:
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
great a prince as you are.

Clown:
Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
is more hotter in France than there.

Clown:
The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
darkness; alias, the devil.

Clown:
I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

Clown:
If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.

COUNTESS:
So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

COUNTESS:
With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
happily effected.

COUNTESS:
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die. I have letters that my son will be here
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
with me till they meet together.

COUNTESS:
You need but plead your honourable privilege.

Clown:
O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

Clown:
But it is your carbonadoed face.

Clown:
Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
and nod at every man.

Clown:
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
Prithee, allow the wind.

Clown:
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
thee further.

Clown:
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
comes himself.
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
your lordship.

COUNTESS:
'Tis past, my liege;
And I beseech your majesty to make it
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
O'erbears it and burns on.

BERTRAM:
My high-repented blames,
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

BERTRAM:
Admiringly, my liege, at first
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object: thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
The dust that did offend it.

COUNTESS:
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

BERTRAM:
Hers it was not.

BERTRAM:
My gracious sovereign,
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
The ring was never hers.

COUNTESS:
Son, on my life,
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
At her life's rate.

BERTRAM:
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture, she ceased
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again.

BERTRAM:
She never saw it.

BERTRAM:
If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was.

COUNTESS:
Now, justice on the doers!

DIANA:
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
Derived from the ancient Capilet:
My suit, as I do understand, you know,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

BERTRAM:
My lord, I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

DIANA:
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

BERTRAM:
She's none of mine, my lord.

DIANA:
If you shall marry,
You give away this hand, and that is mine;
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
You give away myself, which is known mine;
For I by vow am so embodied yours,
That she which marries you must marry me,
Either both or none.

BERTRAM:
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

DIANA:
Good my lord,
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
He had not my virginity.

BERTRAM:
She's impudent, my lord,
And was a common gamester to the camp.

DIANA:
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
He might have bought me at a common price:
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
If I be one.

COUNTESS:
He blushes, and 'tis it:
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
That ring's a thousand proofs.

DIANA:
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

BERTRAM:
What of him?
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
That will speak any thing?

BERTRAM:
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancy's course
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
And I had that which any inferior might
At market-price have bought.

DIANA:
I must be patient:
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again.

BERTRAM:
I have it not.

DIANA:
Sir, much like
The same upon your finger.

DIANA:
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

DIANA:
I have spoke the truth.

BERTRAM:
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

DIANA:
Ay, my lord.

DIANA:
Do you know he promised me marriage?

DIANA:
Ay, my good lord.

DIANA:
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

DIANA:
It was not lent me neither.

DIANA:
I found it not.

DIANA:
I never gave it him.

DIANA:
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

DIANA:
I'll never tell you.

DIANA:
I'll put in bail, my liege.

DIANA:
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

DIANA:
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

DIANA:
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
And at that time he got his wife with child:
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
And now behold the meaning.

BERTRAM:
Both, both. O, pardon!

BERTRAM:
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
Since last we saw in France?

BUCKINGHAM:
An untimely ague
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Met in the vale of Andren.

BUCKINGHAM:
All the whole time
I was my chamber's prisoner.

BUCKINGHAM:
O, you go far.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who did guide,
I mean, who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together, as you guess?

BUCKINGHAM:
I pray you, who, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
From his ambitious finger. What had he
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
And keep it from the earth.

ABERGAVENNY:
I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
Or has given all before, and he begins
A new hell in himself.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why the devil,
Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Of all the gentry; for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,
The honourable board of council out,
Must fetch him in the papers.

ABERGAVENNY:
I do know
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
By this so sickened their estates, that never
They shall abound as formerly.

BUCKINGHAM:
O, many
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
For this great journey. What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue?

BUCKINGHAM:
Every man,
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke
Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
The sudden breach on't.

ABERGAVENNY:
Is it therefore
The ambassador is silenced?

ABERGAVENNY:
A proper title of a peace; and purchased
At a superfluous rate!

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, all this business
Our reverend cardinal carried.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
Where's his examination?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Is he in person ready?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham
Shall lessen this big look.

BUCKINGHAM:
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
Outworths a noble's blood.

BUCKINGHAM:
I read in's looks
Matter against me; and his eye reviled
Me, as his abject object: at this instant
He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
I'll follow and outstare him.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll to the king;
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
There's difference in no persons.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sir,
I am thankful to you; and I'll go along
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
From sincere motions, by intelligence,
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
We see each grain of gravel, I do know
To be corrupt and treasonous.

BUCKINGHAM:
To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
As able to perform't; his mind and place
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home, suggests the king our master
To this last costly treaty, the interview,
That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
Did break i' the rinsing.

BUCKINGHAM:
Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
The articles o' the combination drew
As himself pleased; and they were ratified
As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
His fears were, that the interview betwixt
England and France might, through their amity,
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
That he would please to alter the king's course,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
And for his own advantage.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, not a syllable:
I  do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof.

BRANDON:
Your office, sergeant; execute it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lo, you, my lord,
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
Under device and practise.

BRANDON:
I am sorry
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
You shall to the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
It will help me nothing
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
Be done in this and all things! I obey.
O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!

BRANDON:
Nay, he must bear you company. The king
Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
How he determines further.

ABERGAVENNY:
As the duke said,
The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure
By me obey'd!

BRANDON:
Here is a warrant from
The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--

BUCKINGHAM:
So, so;
These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.

BRANDON:
A monk o' the Chartreux.

BUCKINGHAM:
O, Nicholas Hopkins?

BRANDON:
He.

BUCKINGHAM:
My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Please you, sir,
I know but of a single part, in aught
Pertains to the state; and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
And for me,
I have no further gone in this than by
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know
My faculties nor person, yet will be
The chronicles of my doing, let me say
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
That virtue must go through. We must not stint
Our necessary actions, in the fear
To cope malicious censurers; which ever,
As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
For our best act. If we shall stand still,
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
We should take root here where we sit, or sit
State-statues only.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
A word with you.
Let there be letters writ to every shire,
Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
Most like a careful subject, have collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Please your highness, note
This dangerous conception in this point.
Not friended by by his wish, to your high person
His will is most malignant; and it stretches
Beyond you, to your friends.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,
and this man out of prison?

Chamberlain:
Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
Men into such strange mysteries?

Chamberlain:
As far as I see, all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;
For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.

Chamberlain:
Death! my lord,
Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,
That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.
How now!
What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?

Chamberlain:
What is't for?

Chamberlain:
I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs
To think an English courtier may be wise,
And never see the Louvre.

Chamberlain:
What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities!

Chamberlain:
Well said, Lord Sands;
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.

Chamberlain:
Sir Thomas,
Whither were you a-going?

Chamberlain:
O, 'tis true:
This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
To many lords and ladies; there will be
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.

Chamberlain:
No doubt he's noble;
He had a black mouth that said other of him.

Chamberlain:
True, they are so:
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
We shall be late else; which I would not be,
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford
This night to be comptrollers.

Chamberlain:
You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.

Chamberlain:
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:
His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;
Two women placed together makes cold weather:
My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;
Pray, sit between these ladies.

ANNE:
Was he mad, sir?

Chamberlain:
Well said, my lord.
So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,
The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
Pass away frowning.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,
Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,
Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;
And to you all, good health.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
My Lord Sands,
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.
Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,
Whose fault is this?

ANNE:
You are a merry gamester,
My Lord Sands.

ANNE:
You cannot show me.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
What's that?

Chamberlain:
Look out there, some of ye.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
What warlike voice,
And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;
By all the laws of war you're privileged.

Chamberlain:
How now! what is't?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Good lord chamberlain,
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;
And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em
Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.
You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.
A good digestion to you all: and once more
I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.
A noble company! what are their pleasures?

Chamberlain:
Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
Of this so noble and so fair assembly
This night to meet here, they could do no less
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
An hour of revels with 'em.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Say, lord chamberlain,
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
My lord!

Chamberlain:
Your grace?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
If I but knew him, with my love and duty
I would surrender it.

Chamberlain:
I will, my lord.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
What say they?

Chamberlain:
Such a one, they all confess,
There is indeed; which they would have your grace
Find out, and he will take it.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Let me see, then.
By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make
My royal choice.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
I am glad
Your grace is grown so pleasant.

Chamberlain:
An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--
The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I' the privy chamber?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Your grace,
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
There's fresher air, my lord,
In the next chamber.

BUCKINGHAM:
All good people,
You that thus far have come to pity me,
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
I have this day received a traitor's judgment,
And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
The law I bear no malice for my death;
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
Is only bitter to him, only dying,
Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
There cannot be those numberless offences
'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:
no black envy
Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
Longer than I have time to tell his years!
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
And when old time shall lead him to his end,
Goodness and he fill up one monument!

BUCKINGHAM:
Nay, Sir Nicholas,
Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
When I came hither, I was lord high constable
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world. I had my trial,
And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,
A little happier than my wretched father:
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
A most unnatural and faithless service!
Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
This from a dying man receive as certain:
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Like water from ye, never found again
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
And when you would say something that is sad,
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

Chamberlain:
'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with
all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and
furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the
best breed in the north. When they were ready to
set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by
commission and main power, took 'em from me; with
this reason: His master would be served before a
subject, if not before the king; which stopped our
mouths, sir.'
I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:
He will have all, I think.

Chamberlain:
Good day to both your graces.

Chamberlain:
I left him private,
Full of sad thoughts and troubles.

Chamberlain:
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
Has crept too near his conscience.

Chamberlain:
Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,
And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare
Look into these affairs see this main end,
The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open
The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon
This bold bad man.

Chamberlain:
Excuse me;
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,
You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:
Health to your lordships.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Sir, you cannot.
I would your grace would give us but an hour
Of private conference.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes, in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms
Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,
Invited by your noble self, hath sent
One general tongue unto us, this good man,
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;
Whom once more I present unto your highness.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
You are so noble. To your highness' hand
I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord
Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
In the unpartial judging of this business.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
I know your majesty has always loved her
So dear in heart, not to deny her that
A woman of less place might ask by law:
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
In this man's place before him?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Yes, he was.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Was he not held a learned man?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Yes, surely.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then
Even of yourself, lord cardinal.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
How! of me?

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
They will not stick to say you envied him,
And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,
That he ran mad and died.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Heaven's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,
If I command him, follows my appointment:
I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,
We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.

ANNE:
Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
His highness having lived so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
Would move a monster.

ANNE:
O, God's will! much better
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
As soul and body's severing.

ANNE:
So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.

ANNE:
By my troth and maidenhead,
I would not be a queen.

ANNE:
Nay, good troth.

ANNE:
No, not for all the riches under heaven.

ANNE:
No, in truth.

ANNE:
How you do talk!
I swear again, I would not be a queen
For all the world.

Chamberlain:
Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know
The secret of your conference?

ANNE:
My good lord,
Not your demand; it values not your asking:
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

Chamberlain:
It was a gentle business, and becoming
The action of good women: there is hope
All will be well.

ANNE:
Now, I pray God, amen!

Chamberlain:
You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings
Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty
Commends his good opinion of you, and
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
Out of his grace he adds.

ANNE:
I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender;
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;
Whose health and royalty I pray for.

Chamberlain:
Lady,
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
The king hath of you.
I have perused her well;
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
But from this lady may proceed a gem
To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,
And say I spoke with you.

ANNE:
My honour'd lord.

ANNE:
This is strange to me.

ANNE:
Come, you are pleasant.

ANNE:
Good lady,
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,
To think what follows.
The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
In our long absence: pray, do not deliver
What here you've heard to her.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
Let silence be commanded.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Be't so. Proceed.

Crier:
Henry King of England, &c.

Crier:
Katharine Queen of England, &c.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
You have here, lady,
And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men
Of singular integrity and learning,
Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled
To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court; as well
For your own quiet, as to rectify
What is unsettled in the king.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
His grace
Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,
It's fit this royal session do proceed;
And that, without delay, their arguments
Be now produced and heard.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Your pleasure, madam?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Be patient yet.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
I do profess
You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects
Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
For you or any: how far I have proceeded,
Or how far further shall, is warranted
By a commission from the consistory,
Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:
The king is present: if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much
As you have done my truth. If he know
That I am free of your report, he knows
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to
Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
And to say so no more.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
The queen is obstinate,
Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
She's going away.

Crier:
Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Most gracious sir,
In humblest manner I require your highness,
That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,
There must I be unloosed, although not there
At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I
Did broach this business to your highness; or
Laid any scruple in your way, which might
Induce you to the question on't? or ever
Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
Be to the prejudice of her present state,
Or touch of her good person?

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
So please your highness,
The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
That we adjourn this court till further day:
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
She intends unto his holiness.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Peace to your highness!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
May it please you noble madam, to withdraw
Into your private chamber, we shall give you
The full cause of our coming.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina
serenissima,--

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Noble lady,
I am sorry my integrity should breed,
And service to his majesty and you,
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
We come not by the way of accusation,
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,
You have too much, good lady; but to know
How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Between the king and you; and to deliver,
Like free and honest men, our just opinions
And comforts to your cause.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Most honour'd madam,
My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,
Forgetting, like a good man your late censure
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
His service and his counsel.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
Your hopes and friends are infinite.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
I would your grace
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Put your main cause into the king's protection;
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
Both for your honour better and your cause;
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
You'll part away disgraced.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
He tells you rightly.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Your rage mistakes us.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Madam, this is a mere distraction;
You turn the good we offer into envy.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Your fears are worse.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Pray, hear me.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
If your grace
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,
Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,
The way of our profession is against it:
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.
For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us
Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS:
Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues
With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,
As yours was put into you, ever casts
Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;
Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please
To trust us in your business, we are ready
To use our utmost studies in your service.

Chamberlain:
My lords, you speak your pleasures:
What he deserves of you and me I know;
What we can do to him, though now the time
Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot
Bar his access to the king, never attempt
Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
Over the king in's tongue.

Chamberlain:
The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
And hedges his own way. But in this point
All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
After his patient's death: the king already
Hath married the fair lady.

Chamberlain:
Now, God incense him,
And let him cry Ha! louder!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
The packet, Cromwell.
Gave't you the king?

CROMWELL:
To his own hand, in's bedchamber.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?

CROMWELL:
Presently
He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,
He did it with a serious mind; a heed
Was in his countenance. You he bade
Attend him here this morning.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Is he ready
To come abroad?

CROMWELL:
I think, by this he is.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Leave me awhile.
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Heaven forgive me!
Ever God bless your highness!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Sir,
For holy offices I have a time; a time
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i' the state; and nature does require
Her times of preservation, which perforce
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
Must give my tendence to.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
And ever may your highness yoke together,
As I will lend you cause, my doing well
With my well saying!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
My studied purposes requite; which went
Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
Have ever come too short of my desires,
Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
To the good of your most sacred person and
The profit of the state. For your great graces
Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
Till death, that winter, kill it.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
I do profess
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--
Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
And throw it from their soul; though perils did
Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,
As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
Should the approach of this wild river break,
And stand unshaken yours.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
What should this mean?
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
No new device to beat this from his brains?
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
The letter, as I live, with all the business
I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
And, from that full meridian of my glory,
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation m the evening,
And no man see me more.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Stay:
Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry
Authority so weighty.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Till I find more than will or words to do it,
I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,
You ask with such a violence, the king,
Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
It must be himself, then.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Proud lord, thou liest:
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
This, and all else
This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
I answer is most false. The duke by law
Found his deserts: how innocent I was
From any private malice in his end,
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
You have as little honesty as honour,
That in the way of loyalty and truth
Toward the king, my ever royal master,
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
And all that love his follies.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
All goodness
Is poison to thy stomach.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
But that I am bound in charity against it!

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
So much fairer
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
When the king knows my truth.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Speak on, sir;
I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
It is to see a nobleman want manners.

Chamberlain:
O my lord,
Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
So little of his great self.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.
Why, how now, Cromwell!

CROMWELL:
I have no power to speak, sir.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
What, amazed
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
I am fall'n indeed.

CROMWELL:
How does your grace?

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Why, well;
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
I know myself now; and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!

CROMWELL:
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
To endure more miseries and greater far
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?

CROMWELL:
The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the king.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
God bless him!

CROMWELL:
The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord chancellor in your place.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
That's somewhat sudden:
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?

CROMWELL:
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
That's news indeed.

CROMWELL:
Last, that the Lady Anne,
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
This day was view'd in open as his queen,
Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Only about her coronation.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
In that one woman I have lost for ever:
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Some little memory of me will stir him--
I know his noble nature--not to let
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
For thine own future safety.

CROMWELL:
O my lord,
Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego
So good, so noble and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
The king shall have my service: but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
O Cromwell,
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
And,--prithee, lead me in:
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
And my integrity to heaven, is all
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

CROMWELL:
Good sir, have patience.

CARDINAL WOLSEY:
So I have. Farewell
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

Both:
You may command us, sir.

CAPUCIUS:
Madam, the same; your servant.

CAPUCIUS:
Noble lady,
First mine own service to your grace; the next,
The king's request that I would visit you;
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Sends you his princely commendations,
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

CAPUCIUS:
Madam, in good health.

CAPUCIUS:
Most willing, madam.

CAPUCIUS:
By heaven, I will,
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

Boy:
It hath struck.

DENNY:
Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,
As you commanded me.

DENNY:
Ay, my good lord.

DENNY:
He attends your highness' pleasure.

CRANMER:

CRANMER:

CRANMER:

CRANMER:
Most dread liege,
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:
If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
What can be said against me.

CRANMER:
God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
The trap is laid for me!

CRANMER:
I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,
That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me
To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
Who waits there? Sure, you know me?

CRANMER:
Why?

CRANMER:
So.

DOCTOR BUTTS:

CRANMER:

DOCTOR BUTTS:
I'll show your grace the strangest sight--

DOCTOR BUTTS:
I think your highness saw this many a day.

DOCTOR BUTTS:
There, my lord:
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;
Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
Pages, and footboys.

Chancellor:
Speak to the business, master-secretary:
Why are we met in council?

CROMWELL:
Please your honours,
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.

CROMWELL:
Yes.

Chancellor:
Let him come in.

Chancellor:
My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry
To sit here at this present, and behold
That chair stand empty: but we all are men,
In our own natures frail, and capable
Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling
The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,
For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,
Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

CRANMER:
My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
And with no little study, that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way, and safely; and the end
Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
Both in his private conscience and his place,
Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
With less allegiance in it! Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
And freely urge against me.

CRANMER:
Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
You are so merciful: I see your end;
'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,
Become a churchman better than ambition:
Win straying souls with modesty again,
Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
But reverence to your calling makes me modest.

CROMWELL:
My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,
By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
However faulty, yet should find respect
For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
To load a falling man.

CROMWELL:
Why, my lord?

CROMWELL:
Not sound?

CROMWELL:
Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

CROMWELL:
Do.
Remember your bold life too.

Chancellor:
This is too much;
Forbear, for shame, my lords.

CROMWELL:
And I.

Chancellor:
Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,
I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
There to remain till the king's further pleasure
Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?

All:
We are.

CRANMER:
Is there no other way of mercy,
But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?

CRANMER:
For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?

CRANMER:
Stay, good my lords,
I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;
By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
To a most noble judge, the king my master.

Chamberlain:
This is the king's ring.

Chancellor:
'Tis now too certain:
How much more is his life in value with him?
Would I were fairly out on't!

CROMWELL:
My mind gave me,
In seeking tales and informations
Against this man, whose honesty the devil
And his disciples only envy at,
Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!

Chancellor:
Thus far,
My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,
If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,
And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
I'm sure, in me.

CRANMER:
The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour: how may I deserve it
That am a poor and humble subject to you?

CRANMER:
And let heaven
Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.

Chamberlain:
Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
When they pass back from the christening.

Chamberlain:
As I live,
If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
They're come already from the christening:
Go, break among the press, and find a way out
To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.

CRANMER:

CRANMER:
Elizabeth.

CRANMER:
Amen.

CRANMER:
Let me speak, sir,
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--
But few now living can behold that goodness--
A pattern to all princes living with her,
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
With all the virtues that attend the good,
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
In her days every man shall eat in safety,
Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
God shall be truly known; and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir,
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,
And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
To all the plains about him: our children's children
Shall see this, and bless heaven.

CRANMER:
She shall be, to the happiness of England,
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Would I had known no more! but she must die,
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

AENEAS:
How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?

AENEAS:
That Paris is returned home and hurt.

AENEAS:
Troilus, by Menelaus.

AENEAS:
Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!

AENEAS:
In all swift haste.

CRESSIDA:
Who were those went by?

ALEXANDER:
Queen Hecuba and Helen.

CRESSIDA:
And whither go they?

ALEXANDER:
Up to the eastern tower,
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
And, like as there were husbandry in war,
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
And to the field goes he; where every flower
Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
In Hector's wrath.

CRESSIDA:
What was his cause of anger?

ALEXANDER:
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
They call him Ajax.

CRESSIDA:
Good; and what of him?

ALEXANDER:
They say he is a very man per se,
And stands alone.

CRESSIDA:
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.

ALEXANDER:
This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.

CRESSIDA:
But how should this man, that makes
me smile, make Hector angry?

ALEXANDER:
They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.

CRESSIDA:
Who comes here?

ALEXANDER:
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.

CRESSIDA:
Hector's a gallant man.

ALEXANDER:
As may be in the world, lady.

CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.

CRESSIDA:
This morning, uncle.

CRESSIDA:
Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.

CRESSIDA:
That were we talking of, and of his anger.

CRESSIDA:
So he says here.

CRESSIDA:
What, is he angry too?

CRESSIDA:
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.

CRESSIDA:
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.

CRESSIDA:
Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.

CRESSIDA:
'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.

CRESSIDA:
So he is.

CRESSIDA:
He is not Hector.

CRESSIDA:
Excuse me.

CRESSIDA:
Pardon me, pardon me.

CRESSIDA:
He shall not need it, if he have his own.

CRESSIDA:
No matter.

CRESSIDA:
'Twould not become him; his own's better.

CRESSIDA:
No, but brown.

CRESSIDA:
To say the truth, true and not true.

CRESSIDA:
Why, Paris hath colour enough.

CRESSIDA:
Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
a copper nose.

CRESSIDA:
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.

CRESSIDA:
Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total.

CRESSIDA:
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?

CRESSIDA:
Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?

CRESSIDA:
O, he smiles valiantly.

CRESSIDA:
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.

CRESSIDA:
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
prove it so.

CRESSIDA:
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.

CRESSIDA:
Without the rack.

CRESSIDA:
Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.

CRESSIDA:
With mill-stones.

CRESSIDA:
But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?

CRESSIDA:
At what was all this laughing?

CRESSIDA:
An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
too.

CRESSIDA:
What was his answer?

CRESSIDA:
This is her question.

CRESSIDA:
So let it now; for it has been while going by.

CRESSIDA:
So I do.

CRESSIDA:
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
against May.

CRESSIDA:
At your pleasure.

CRESSIDA:
Speak not so loud.

CRESSIDA:
Who's that?

CRESSIDA:
Will he give you the nod?

CRESSIDA:
If he do, the rich shall have more.

CRESSIDA:
O, a brave man!

CRESSIDA:
Be those with swords?

CRESSIDA:
Who's that?

CRESSIDA:
Can Helenus fight, uncle?

CRESSIDA:
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?

CRESSIDA:
Peace, for shame, peace!

CRESSIDA:
Here come more.

CRESSIDA:
There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.

CRESSIDA:
Well, well.

CRESSIDA:
Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
in the pie, for then the man's date's out.

CRESSIDA:
Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
thousand watches.

CRESSIDA:
Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
past watching.

Boy:
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.

Boy:
At your own house; there he unarms him.

CRESSIDA:
Adieu, uncle.

CRESSIDA:
To bring, uncle?

CRESSIDA:
By the same token, you are a bawd.
Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
He offers in another's enterprise;
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

AGAMEMNON:
Princes,
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before,
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove
To find persistive constancy in men:
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
And what hath mass or matter, by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

AGAMEMNON:
Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
That matter needless, of importless burden,
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
We shall hear music, wit and oracle.

AGAMEMNON:
The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
What is the remedy?

AGAMEMNON:
What trumpet? look, Menelaus.

AGAMEMNON:
What would you 'fore our tent?

AENEAS:
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?

AGAMEMNON:
Even this.

AENEAS:
May one, that is a herald and a prince,
Do a fair message to his kingly ears?

AGAMEMNON:
With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general.

AENEAS:
Fair leave and large security. How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals?

AGAMEMNON:
How!

AENEAS:
Ay;
I ask, that I might waken reverence,
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus:
Which is that god in office, guiding men?
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?

AGAMEMNON:
This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers.

AENEAS:
Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
Jove's accord,
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
But what the repining enemy commends,
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
transcends.

AGAMEMNON:
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?

AENEAS:
Ay, Greek, that is my name.

AGAMEMNON:
What's your affair I pray you?

AENEAS:
Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.

AGAMEMNON:
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.

AENEAS:
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
To set his sense on the attentive bent,
And then to speak.

AGAMEMNON:
Speak frankly as the wind;
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
He tells thee so himself.

AENEAS:
Trumpet, blow loud,
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
That holds his honour higher than his ease,
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
That loves his mistress more than in confession,
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
If any come, Hector shall honour him;
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.

AGAMEMNON:
This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
If none of them have soul in such a kind,
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.

AENEAS:
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!

AGAMEMNON:
Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
Achilles shall have word of this intent;
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe.

AJAX:
Thersites!

AJAX:
Thersites!

AJAX:
Dog!

AJAX:
Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
Feel, then.

AJAX:
Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
beat thee into handsomeness.

AJAX:
Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.

AJAX:
The proclamation!

AJAX:
Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.

AJAX:
I say, the proclamation!

AJAX:
Mistress Thersites!

AJAX:
Cobloaf!

AJAX:

AJAX:
Thou stool for a witch!

AJAX:
You dog!

AJAX:

ACHILLES:
Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
Thersites! what's the matter, man?

ACHILLES:
Ay; what's the matter?

ACHILLES:
So I do: what's the matter?

ACHILLES:
'Well!' why, I do so.

ACHILLES:
I know that, fool.

AJAX:
Therefore I beat thee.

ACHILLES:
What?

ACHILLES:
Nay, good Ajax.

ACHILLES:
Nay, I must hold you.

ACHILLES:
Peace, fool!

AJAX:
O thou damned cur! I shall--

ACHILLES:
Will you set your wit to a fool's?

ACHILLES:
What's the quarrel?

AJAX:
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
proclamation, and he rails upon me.

AJAX:
Well, go to, go to.

ACHILLES:
Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.

ACHILLES:
What, with me too, Thersites?

ACHILLES:
What, what?

AJAX:
I shall cut out your tongue.

ACHILLES:
There's for you, Patroclus.

ACHILLES:
Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.

AJAX:
Farewell. Who shall answer him?

ACHILLES:
I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
He knew his man.

AJAX:
O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.

CASSANDRA:

CASSANDRA:

CASSANDRA:
Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

CASSANDRA:
Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.

ACHILLES:
Who's there?

ACHILLES:
Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?

ACHILLES:
O, tell, tell.

ACHILLES:
He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.

ACHILLES:
Derive this; come.

ACHILLES:
Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
Come in with me, Thersites.

AGAMEMNON:
Where is Achilles?

AGAMEMNON:
Let it be known to him that we are here.
He shent our messengers; and we lay by
Our appertainments, visiting of him:
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place,
Or know not what we are.

AJAX:
Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
cause. A word, my lord.

AGAMEMNON:
Hear you, Patroclus:
We are too well acquainted with these answers:
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
If you do say we think him over-proud
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance; yea, watch
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
That if he overhold his price so much,
We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
Not portable, lie under this report:
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.

AGAMEMNON:
In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.

AJAX:
What is he more than another?

AGAMEMNON:
No more than what he thinks he is.

AJAX:
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
better man than I am?

AGAMEMNON:
No question.

AJAX:
Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?

AGAMEMNON:
No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
more tractable.

AJAX:
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
know not what pride is.

AGAMEMNON:
Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
the deed in the praise.

AJAX:
I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.

AGAMEMNON:
What's his excuse?

AGAMEMNON:
Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us?

AGAMEMNON:
Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
At your request a little from himself.

DIOMEDES:

AJAX:
If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.

AGAMEMNON:
O, no, you shall not go.

AJAX:
An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
Let me go to him.

AJAX:
A paltry, insolent fellow!

AJAX:
Can he not be sociable?

AJAX:
I'll let his humours blood.

AGAMEMNON:
He will be the physician that should be the patient.

AJAX:
An all men were o' my mind,--

AJAX:
A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
shall pride carry it?

AJAX:
I will knead him; I'll make him supple.

DIOMEDES:
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.

AJAX:
A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
Would he were a Trojan!

DIOMEDES:
Or covetous of praise,--

DIOMEDES:
Or strange, or self-affected!

AJAX:
Shall I call you father?

DIOMEDES:
Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.

AGAMEMNON:
Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.

Boy:
No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.

CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?

CRESSIDA:
Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!

CRESSIDA:
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.

CRESSIDA:
Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
fear the worst oft cures the worse.

CRESSIDA:
Nor nothing monstrous neither?

CRESSIDA:
They say all lovers swear more performance than they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
are they not monsters?

CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?

CRESSIDA:
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.

CRESSIDA:
Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
For many weary months.

CRESSIDA:
Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
I love you now; but not, till now, so much
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

CRESSIDA:
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

CRESSIDA:
Pray you, content you.

CRESSIDA:
Sir, mine own company.

CRESSIDA:
Let me go and try:
I have a kind of self resides with you;
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
To be another's fool. I would be gone:
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

CRESSIDA:
Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
And fell so roundly to a large confession,
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.

CRESSIDA:
In that I'll war with you.

CRESSIDA:
Prophet may you be!
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
When time is old and hath forgot itself,
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
And mighty states characterless are grated
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
From false to false, among false maids in love,
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
'As false as Cressid.'

CRESSIDA:
Amen.

CALCHAS:
Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
From certain and possess'd conveniences,
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
And here, to do you service, am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit,
Out of those many register'd in promise,
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

AGAMEMNON:
What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.

CALCHAS:
You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack,
Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
In most accepted pain.

AGAMEMNON:
Let Diomedes bear him,
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.

DIOMEDES:
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.

AGAMEMNON:
We'll execute your purpose, and put on
A form of strangeness as we pass along:
So do each lord, and either greet him not,
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.

ACHILLES:
What, comes the general to speak with me?
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

AGAMEMNON:
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?

ACHILLES:
No.

AGAMEMNON:
The better.

ACHILLES:
Good day, good day.

ACHILLES:
What, does the cuckold scorn me?

AJAX:
How now, Patroclus!

ACHILLES:
Good morrow, Ajax.

AJAX:
Ha?

ACHILLES:
Good morrow.

AJAX:
Ay, and good next day too.

ACHILLES:
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

ACHILLES:
What, am I poor of late?
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
And not a man, for being simply man,
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
Do one pluck down another and together
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess,
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
I'll interrupt his reading.
How now Ulysses!

ACHILLES:
What are you reading?

ACHILLES:
This is not strange, Ulysses.
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not, but commends itself
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
Salutes each other with each other's form;
For speculation turns not to itself,
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

ACHILLES:
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?

ACHILLES:
Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons.

ACHILLES:
Ha! known!

ACHILLES:
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

ACHILLES:
I see my reputation is at stake
My fame is shrewdly gored.

ACHILLES:
Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
An appetite that I am sick withal,
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
To talk with him and to behold his visage,
Even to my full of view.
A labour saved!

ACHILLES:
What?

ACHILLES:
How so?

ACHILLES:
How can that be?

ACHILLES:
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

ACHILLES:
To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
et cetera. Do this.

ACHILLES:
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

ACHILLES:
Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

ACHILLES:
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
And I myself see not the bottom of it.

DEIPHOBUS:
It is the Lord AEneas.

AENEAS:
Is the prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.

DIOMEDES:
That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.

AENEAS:
Health to you, valiant sir,
During all question of the gentle truce;
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute.

DIOMEDES:
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit and policy.

AENEAS:
And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill more excellently.

DIOMEDES:
We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!

AENEAS:
We know each other well.

DIOMEDES:
We do; and long to know each other worse.

AENEAS:
I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.

AENEAS:
That I assure you:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy.

AENEAS:
Good morrow, all.

DIOMEDES:
Both alike:
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.

DIOMEDES:
She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight,
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.

CRESSIDA:
Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
He shall unbolt the gates.

CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, then.

CRESSIDA:
Are you a-weary of me?

CRESSIDA:
Night hath been too brief.

CRESSIDA:
Prithee, tarry:
You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
And then you would have tarried. Hark!
there's one up.

CRESSIDA:
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
I shall have such a life!

CRESSIDA:
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.

CRESSIDA:
Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
Nor suffer others.

CRESSIDA:
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
My lord, come you again into my chamber:
You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.

CRESSIDA:
Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.

AENEAS:
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.

AENEAS:
Is not Prince Troilus here?

AENEAS:
Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
It doth import him much to speak with me.

AENEAS:
Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
fetch him hither; go.

AENEAS:
My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
My matter is so rash: there is at hand
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
We must give up to Diomedes' hand
The Lady Cressida.

AENEAS:
By Priam and the general state of Troy:
They are at hand and ready to effect it.

AENEAS:
Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
Have not more gift in taciturnity.

CRESSIDA:
How now! what's the matter? who was here?

CRESSIDA:
Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?

CRESSIDA:
O the gods! what's the matter?

CRESSIDA:
Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
what's the matter?

CRESSIDA:
O you immortal gods! I will not go.

CRESSIDA:
I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
I know no touch of consanguinity;
No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
Do to this body what extremes you can;
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth,
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--

CRESSIDA:
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.

CRESSIDA:
Why tell you me of moderation?
The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
And violenteth in a sense as strong
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
If I could temporize with my affection,
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
The like allayment could I give my grief.
My love admits no qualifying dross;
No more my grief, in such a precious loss.

CRESSIDA:
O Troilus! Troilus!

CRESSIDA:
Have the gods envy?

CRESSIDA:
And is it true that I must go from Troy?

CRESSIDA:
What, and from Troilus too?

CRESSIDA:
Is it possible?

AENEAS:

CRESSIDA:
I must then to the Grecians?

CRESSIDA:
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?

CRESSIDA:
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?

CRESSIDA:
O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.

CRESSIDA:
And you this glove. When shall I see you?

CRESSIDA:
O heavens! 'be true' again!

CRESSIDA:
O heavens! you love me not.

CRESSIDA:
Do you think I will?

AENEAS:

CRESSIDA:
My lord, will you be true?

DIOMEDES:
Fair Lady Cressid,
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.

DIOMEDES:
O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
Let me be privileged by my place and message,
To be a speaker free; when I am hence
I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'

AENEAS:
How have we spent this morning!
The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
That sore to ride before him to the field.

DEIPHOBUS:
Let us make ready straight.

AENEAS:
Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry.

AGAMEMNON:
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him hither.

AJAX:
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
Thou blow'st for Hector.

ACHILLES:
'Tis but early days.

AGAMEMNON:
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?

AGAMEMNON:
Is this the Lady Cressid?

DIOMEDES:
Even she.

AGAMEMNON:
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.

ACHILLES:
I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
Achilles bids you welcome.

CRESSIDA:
In kissing, do you render or receive?

CRESSIDA:
I'll make my match to live,
The kiss you take is better than you give;
Therefore no kiss.

CRESSIDA:
You're an odd man; give even or give none.

CRESSIDA:
No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
That you are odd, and he is even with you.

CRESSIDA:
No, I'll be sworn.

CRESSIDA:
You may.

CRESSIDA:
Why, beg, then.

CRESSIDA:
I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.

DIOMEDES:
Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.

ALL:
The Trojans' trumpet.

AGAMEMNON:
Yonder comes the troop.

AENEAS:
Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
A victor shall be known? will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other, or shall be divided
By any voice or order of the field?
Hector bade ask.

AGAMEMNON:
Which way would Hector have it?

AENEAS:
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.

ACHILLES:
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
The knight opposed.

AENEAS:
If not Achilles, sir,
What is your name?

ACHILLES:
If not Achilles, nothing.

AENEAS:
Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
In the extremity of great and little,
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
The one almost as infinite as all,
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.

ACHILLES:
A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.

AGAMEMNON:
Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,
So be it; either to the uttermost,
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

AGAMEMNON:
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?

AGAMEMNON:
They are in action.

AGAMEMNON:
His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!

DIOMEDES:
You must no more.

AENEAS:
Princes, enough, so please you.

AJAX:
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

DIOMEDES:
As Hector pleases.

AJAX:
I thank thee, Hector
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death.

AENEAS:
There is expectance here from both the sides,
What further you will do.

AJAX:
If I might in entreaties find success--
As seld I have the chance--I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.

DIOMEDES:
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.

AJAX:
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

AGAMEMNON:
Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy;
But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

AGAMEMNON:

AENEAS:
The noble Menelaus.

AENEAS:
'Tis the old Nestor.

ACHILLES:
I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
And quoted joint by joint.

ACHILLES:
I am Achilles.

ACHILLES:
Behold thy fill.

ACHILLES:
Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.

ACHILLES:
Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!

ACHILLES:
I tell thee, yea.

AJAX:
Do not chafe thee, cousin:
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
You may have every day enough of Hector
If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.

ACHILLES:
Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
To-night all friends.

AGAMEMNON:
First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
There in the full convive we: afterwards,
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
That this great soldier may his welcome know.

ACHILLES:
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.

ACHILLES:
How now, thou core of envy!
Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?

ACHILLES:
From whence, fragment?

ACHILLES:
My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
This night in banqueting must all be spent.
Away, Patroclus!

AGAMEMNON:
We go wrong, we go wrong.

AJAX:
No, yonder 'tis;
There, where we see the lights.

AJAX:
No, not a whit.

ACHILLES:
Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.

AGAMEMNON:
So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.

ACHILLES:
Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
That go or tarry.

AGAMEMNON:
Good night.

ACHILLES:
Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
Keep Hector company an hour or two.

DIOMEDES:
I cannot, lord; I have important business,
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.

ACHILLES:
Come, come, enter my tent.

DIOMEDES:
What, are you up here, ho? speak.

CALCHAS:

DIOMEDES:
Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?

CALCHAS:

DIOMEDES:
How now, my charge!

CRESSIDA:
Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.

DIOMEDES:
Will you remember?

CRESSIDA:
Remember! yes.

DIOMEDES:
Nay, but do, then;
And let your mind be coupled with your words.

CRESSIDA:
Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.

DIOMEDES:
Nay, then,--

CRESSIDA:
I'll tell you what,--

DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?

DIOMEDES:
What did you swear you would bestow on me?

CRESSIDA:
I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.

DIOMEDES:
Good night.

CRESSIDA:
Diomed,--

DIOMEDES:
No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.

CRESSIDA:
Hark, one word in your ear.

DIOMEDES:
And so, good night.

CRESSIDA:
Nay, but you part in anger.

CRESSIDA:
Guardian!--why, Greek!

DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I do not: come hither once again.

DIOMEDES:
But will you, then?

CRESSIDA:
In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.

DIOMEDES:
Give me some token for the surety of it.

CRESSIDA:
I'll fetch you one.

CRESSIDA:
Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.

CRESSIDA:
You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.

DIOMEDES:
Whose was't?

CRESSIDA:
It is no matter, now I have't again.
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.

DIOMEDES:
I shall have it.

CRESSIDA:
What, this?

DIOMEDES:
Ay, that.

CRESSIDA:
O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.

DIOMEDES:
I had your heart before, this follows it.

CRESSIDA:
You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
I'll give you something else.

DIOMEDES:
I will have this: whose was it?

CRESSIDA:
It is no matter.

DIOMEDES:
Come, tell me whose it was.

CRESSIDA:
'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
But, now you have it, take it.

DIOMEDES:
Whose was it?

CRESSIDA:
By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.

DIOMEDES:
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.

CRESSIDA:
Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
I will not keep my word.

DIOMEDES:
Why, then, farewell;
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.

CRESSIDA:
You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
But it straight starts you.

DIOMEDES:
I do not like this fooling.

DIOMEDES:
What, shall I come? the hour?

CRESSIDA:
Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.

DIOMEDES:
Farewell till then.

CRESSIDA:
Good night: I prithee, come.
Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
The error of our eye directs our mind:
What error leads must err; O, then conclude
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.

AENEAS:
I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.

ANDROMACHE:
When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
To stop his ears against admonishment?
Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.

ANDROMACHE:
My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.

CASSANDRA:
Where is my brother Hector?

ANDROMACHE:
Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

CASSANDRA:
O, 'tis true.

CASSANDRA:
No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.

CASSANDRA:
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

ANDROMACHE:
O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
And rob in the behalf of charity.

CASSANDRA:
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
But vows to every purpose must not hold:
Unarm, sweet Hector.

ANDROMACHE:
Cassandra, call my father to persuade.

CASSANDRA:
Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
Fall all together.

CASSANDRA:
O Priam, yield not to him!

ANDROMACHE:
Do not, dear father.

CASSANDRA:
O, farewell, dear Hector!
Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
Like witless antics, one another meet,
And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!

CASSANDRA:
Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.

DIOMEDES:
Thou dost miscall retire:
I do not fly, but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
Have at thee!

DIOMEDES:
Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
And am her knight by proof.

AGAMEMNON:
Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
Hath Doreus prisoner,
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
Upon the pashed corses of the kings
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
To reinforcement, or we perish all.

AJAX:
Troilus! thou coward Troilus!

DIOMEDES:
Ay, there, there.

ACHILLES:
Where is this Hector?
Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;
Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.

AJAX:
Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!

DIOMEDES:
Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?

AJAX:
What wouldst thou?

DIOMEDES:
I would correct him.

AJAX:
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!

DIOMEDES:
Ha, art thou there?

AJAX:
I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.

DIOMEDES:
He is my prize; I will not look upon.

ACHILLES:
Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!

ACHILLES:
I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
Be happy that my arms are out of use:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.

ACHILLES:
Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
And when I have the bloody Hector found,
Empale him with your weapons round about;
In fellest manner execute your aims.
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
It is decreed Hector the great must die.

ACHILLES:
Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
To close the day up, Hector's life is done.

ACHILLES:
Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.

ACHILLES:
The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.

AGAMEMNON:
Hark! hark! what shout is that?

DIOMEDES:
The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.

AJAX:
If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was a man as good as he.

AGAMEMNON:
March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

AENEAS:
Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
Never go home; here starve we out the night.

ALL:
Hector! the gods forbid!

AENEAS:
My lord, you do discomfort all the host!

ANTONIO:
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.

ANTONIO:
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

ANTONIO:
Fie, fie!

ANTONIO:
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

BASSANIO:
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

BASSANIO:
I will not fail you.

ANTONIO:
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.

ANTONIO:
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

ANTONIO:
Is that any thing now?

BASSANIO:
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
have them, they are not worth the search.

ANTONIO:
Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

BASSANIO:
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

ANTONIO:
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

BASSANIO:
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

ANTONIO:
You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

BASSANIO:
In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!

ANTONIO:
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.

BASSANIO:
Ay, sir, for three months.

BASSANIO:
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

BASSANIO:
May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
know your answer?

BASSANIO:
Your answer to that.

BASSANIO:
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

BASSANIO:
Be assured you may.

BASSANIO:
If it please you to dine with us.

BASSANIO:
This is Signior Antonio.

BASSANIO:
Shylock, do you hear?

ANTONIO:
Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

ANTONIO:
And for three months.

ANTONIO:
I do never use it.

ANTONIO:
And what of him? did he take interest?

ANTONIO:
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

ANTONIO:
Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

ANTONIO:
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

ANTONIO:
I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.

BASSANIO:
This were kindness.

ANTONIO:
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

BASSANIO:
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

ANTONIO:
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

ANTONIO:
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

ANTONIO:
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

BASSANIO:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

ANTONIO:
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.

BASSANIO:
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

BASSANIO:
Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?

BASSANIO:
One speak for both. What would you?

BASSANIO:
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

BASSANIO:
Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out. Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

BASSANIO:
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

BASSANIO:
Gratiano!

BASSANIO:
You have obtain'd it.

BASSANIO:
Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.

BASSANIO:
Well, we shall see your bearing.

BASSANIO:
No, that were pity:
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
I have some business.

ANTONIO:
Who's there?

ANTONIO:
Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

ARRAGON:
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

ARRAGON:
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

ARRAGON:
What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

ARRAGON:
What is here?
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is,
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.

BASSANIO:
Let me choose
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

BASSANIO:
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

BASSANIO:
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

BASSANIO:
'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

ALL:
Ding, dong, bell.

BASSANIO:
So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valour's excrement
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

BASSANIO:
What find I here?
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

BASSANIO:
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

BASSANIO:
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

BASSANIO:
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

BASSANIO:
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

BASSANIO:
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.

BASSANIO:
Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

BASSANIO:
O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?

BASSANIO:
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

BASSANIO:
For me three thousand ducats.

BASSANIO:

BASSANIO:
Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste: but, till I come again,
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

ANTONIO:
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

ANTONIO:
I pray thee, hear me speak.

ANTONIO:
Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.

ANTONIO:
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

BALTHASAR:
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

DUKE:
What, is Antonio here?

ANTONIO:
Ready, so please your grace.

DUKE:
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.

ANTONIO:
I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.

DUKE:
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

DUKE:
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

BASSANIO:
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

BASSANIO:
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

BASSANIO:
Every offence is not a hate at first.

ANTONIO:
I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

BASSANIO:
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

DUKE:
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

DUKE:
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.

DUKE:
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

BASSANIO:
Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

ANTONIO:
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

DUKE:
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

BASSANIO:
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

DUKE:
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?

DUKE:
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

Clerk:

DUKE:
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?

DUKE:
You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

DUKE:
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

ANTONIO:
Ay, so he says.

ANTONIO:
I do.

BASSANIO:
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

ANTONIO:
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.

ANTONIO:
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

BASSANIO:
Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.

BASSANIO:
Here is the money.

BASSANIO:
I have it ready for thee; here it is.

DUKE:
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

ANTONIO:
So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

DUKE:
He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.

DUKE:
Get thee gone, but do it.

DUKE:
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

DUKE:
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

BASSANIO:
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

ANTONIO:
And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.

BASSANIO:
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

BASSANIO:
This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
I will not shame myself to give you this.

BASSANIO:
There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

BASSANIO:
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.

ANTONIO:
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued against your wife's commandment.

BASSANIO:
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
Come, you and I will thither presently;
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.

BASSANIO:
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

BASSANIO:
I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

ANTONIO:
No more than I am well acquitted of.

BASSANIO:

BASSANIO:
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

BASSANIO:
Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

BASSANIO:
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

ANTONIO:
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

BASSANIO:
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--

BASSANIO:
Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.

ANTONIO:
I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

ANTONIO:
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

BASSANIO:
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

ANTONIO:
I am dumb.

BASSANIO:
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

BASSANIO:
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

ANTONIO:
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.

ALL:
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

DUNCAN:
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

DUNCAN:
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

DUNCAN:
Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

DUNCAN:
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
Who comes here?

DUNCAN:
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

DUNCAN:
Great happiness!

DUNCAN:
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

DUNCAN:
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

ALL:
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! the charm's wound up.

BANQUO:
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

BANQUO:
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.

BANQUO:
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

BANQUO:
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

BANQUO:
You shall be king.

BANQUO:
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

ANGUS:
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.

BANQUO:
What, can the devil speak true?

ANGUS:
Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.

BANQUO:
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.

BANQUO:
Look, how our partner's rapt.

BANQUO:
New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.

BANQUO:
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

BANQUO:
Very gladly.

DUNCAN:
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?

DUNCAN:
There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.

DUNCAN:
Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO:
There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN:
My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.

DUNCAN:
My worthy Cawdor!

DUNCAN:
True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.

DUNCAN:
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO:
This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.

DUNCAN:
See, see, our honour'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.

DUNCAN:
Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.

DUNCAN:
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.

BANQUO:
How goes the night, boy?

BANQUO:
And she goes down at twelve.

BANQUO:
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Give me my sword.
Who's there?

BANQUO:
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.

BANQUO:
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.

BANQUO:
At your kind'st leisure.

BANQUO:
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd.

BANQUO:
Thanks, sir: the like to you!

BANQUO:
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.

DONALBAIN:
What is amiss?

DONALBAIN:

BANQUO:
Look to the lady:
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.

ALL:
So all.

ALL:
Well contented.

DONALBAIN:
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.

BANQUO:
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.

BANQUO:
Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.

BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord.

BANQUO:
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.

BANQUO:
My lord, I will not.

BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

ATTENDANT:
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

Both Murderers:
True, my lord.

Both Murderers:
We are resolved, my lord.

BANQUO:

BANQUO:
It will be rain to-night.

BANQUO:
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

ALL:
A deed without a name.

ALL:
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!

ALL:
Listen, but speak not to't.

ALL:
Seek to know no more.

ALL:
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!

Doctor:
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The great assay of art; but at his touch--
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
They presently amend.

Doctor:
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

Doctor:
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
time, have you heard her say?

Doctor:
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

Doctor:
How came she by that light?

Doctor:
You see, her eyes are open.

Doctor:
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

Doctor:
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

Doctor:
Do you mark that?

Doctor:
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

Doctor:
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

Doctor:
Well, well, well,--

Doctor:
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds.

Doctor:
Even so?

Doctor:
Will she go now to bed?

Doctor:
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.

ANGUS:
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS:
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

CAITHNESS:
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS:
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.

CAITHNESS:
Well, march we on,
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.

Doctor:
Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.

Doctor:
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

Doctor:
Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

Doctor:

ALL:
Hail, King of Scotland!

EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

EGEUS:
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

DEMETRIUS:
Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.

EGEUS:
With duty and desire we follow you.

BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by man,
according to the scrip.

BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.

BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

BOTTOM:
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?

BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
more condoling.

BOTTOM:
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!'

BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.

BOTTOM:
Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
let him roar again.'

ALL:
That would hang us, every mother's son.

BOTTOM:
I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
nightingale.

BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
to play it in?

BOTTOM:
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.

BOTTOM:
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

BOTTOM:
Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

DEMETRIUS:
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?

DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.

DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.

DEMETRIUS:
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

DEMETRIUS:
Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.

BOTTOM:
Are we all met?

BOTTOM:
Peter Quince,--

BOTTOM:
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?

BOTTOM:
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
out of fear.

BOTTOM:
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to 't.

BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

BOTTOM:
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.

BOTTOM:
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.

BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.

BOTTOM:
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--

BOTTOM:
--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.

BOTTOM:
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.

BOTTOM:
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
make me afeard.

BOTTOM:
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
you?

BOTTOM:
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
I am not afraid.
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill,--

BOTTOM:

BOTTOM:
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

BOTTOM:
Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.

COBWEB:
And I.

ALL:
Where shall we go?

COBWEB:
Hail!

BOTTOM:
I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
worship's name.

COBWEB:
Cobweb.

BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
you. Your name, honest gentleman?

BOTTOM:
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?

BOTTOM:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
desire your more acquaintance, good Master
Mustardseed.

DEMETRIUS:
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

DEMETRIUS:
So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

DEMETRIUS:
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

DEMETRIUS:
An if I could, what should I get therefore?

DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.

DEMETRIUS:

DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.

DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

DEMETRIUS:
I say I love thee more than he can do.

DEMETRIUS:
Quick, come!

DEMETRIUS:
No, no; he'll
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!

DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.

DEMETRIUS:
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

DEMETRIUS:
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.

DEMETRIUS:
Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.

DEMETRIUS:
Lysander! speak again:
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?

DEMETRIUS:
Yea, art thou there?

DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?

DEMETRIUS:
Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.

BOTTOM:
Where's Peaseblossom?

BOTTOM:
Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

COBWEB:
Ready.

BOTTOM:
Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
I would be loath to have you overflown with a
honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?

BOTTOM:
Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.

BOTTOM:
Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
I must scratch.

BOTTOM:
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
the tongs and the bones.

BOTTOM:
Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.

BOTTOM:
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

EGEUS:
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
I wonder of their being here together.

EGEUS:
It is, my lord.

EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me,
You of your wife and me of my consent,
Of my consent that she should be your wife.

DEMETRIUS:
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
And I in fury hither follow'd them,
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.

DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small and undistinguishable,

DEMETRIUS:
Are you sure
That we are awake? It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?

DEMETRIUS:
Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
And by the way let us recount our dreams.

BOTTOM:

BOTTOM:
Where are these lads? where are these hearts?

BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.

BOTTOM:
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.

DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.

DEMETRIUS:
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning.

DEMETRIUS:
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.

DEMETRIUS:
Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.

DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head.

DEMETRIUS:
He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
see, it is already in snuff.

DEMETRIUS:
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.

DEMETRIUS:
Well roared, Lion.

DEMETRIUS:
And then came Pyramus.

DEMETRIUS:
No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.

DEMETRIUS:
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
she for a woman, God bless us.

DEMETRIUS:
And thus she means, videlicet:--

DEMETRIUS:
Ay, and Wall too.

BOTTOM:

DUMAIN:
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.

BIRON:
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

BIRON:
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

BIRON:
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.

FERDINAND:
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

BIRON:
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

FERDINAND:
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.

BIRON:
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

BIRON:
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

DUMAIN:
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

BIRON:
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN:
How follows that?

BIRON:
Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN:
In reason nothing.

BIRON:
Something then in rhyme.

BIRON:
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

BIRON:
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

BIRON:

BIRON:
Let's see the penalty.
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?

BIRON:
Sweet lord, and why?

BIRON:
A dangerous law against gentility!
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

BIRON:
So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

FERDINAND:
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.

BIRON:
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might master'd but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

BIRON:
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

DULL:
Which is the duke's own person?

BIRON:
This, fellow: what wouldst?

DULL:
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.

BIRON:
This is he.

DULL:
Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD:
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

BIRON:
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

BIRON:
To hear? or forbear laughing?

BIRON:
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.

COSTARD:
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BIRON:
In what manner?

COSTARD:
In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.

BIRON:
For the following, sir?

COSTARD:
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!

FERDINAND:
Will you hear this letter with attention?

BIRON:
As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD:
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

FERDINAND:

COSTARD:
Not a word of Costard yet.

COSTARD:
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.

COSTARD:
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!

FERDINAND:
No words!

COSTARD:
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

COSTARD:
Me?

COSTARD:
Me?

COSTARD:
Still me?

COSTARD:
O, me!

COSTARD:
With a wench.

DULL:
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

BIRON:
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.

COSTARD:
Sir, I confess the wench.

COSTARD:
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.

COSTARD:
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.

COSTARD:
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.

COSTARD:
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.

COSTARD:
This maid will serve my turn, sir.

COSTARD:
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

BIRON:
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD:
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why tough senior? why tough senior?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Pretty and apt.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou pretty, because little.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And therefore apt, because quick.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
In thy condign praise.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What, that an eel is ingenious?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love not to be crossed.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I have promised to study three years with the duke.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Impossible.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
It doth amount to one more than two.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
True.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most fine figure!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Of what complexion?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Tell me precisely of what complexion.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is that one of the four complexions?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
My love is most immaculate white and red.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Define, define, well-educated infant.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say, sing.

DULL:
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will visit thee at the lodge.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I know where it is situate.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will tell thee wonders.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love thee.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And so, farewell.

DULL:
Come, Jaquenetta, away!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.

COSTARD:
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD:
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Take away this villain; shut him up.

COSTARD:
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

COSTARD:
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.

COSTARD:
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

BOYET:
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

BOYET:
Proud of employment, willingly I go.

BOYET:
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.

FERDINAND:
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

FERDINAND:
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

FERDINAND:
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

FERDINAND:
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

FERDINAND:
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

FERDINAND:
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

BIRON:
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BIRON:
I know you did.

BIRON:
You must not be so quick.

BIRON:
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

BIRON:
What time o' day?

BIRON:
Now fair befall your mask!

BIRON:
And send you many lovers!

BIRON:
Nay, then will I be gone.

BOYET:
So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

BIRON:
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

BIRON:
I would you heard it groan.

BIRON:
Sick at the heart.

BIRON:
Would that do it good?

BIRON:
Will you prick't with your eye?

BIRON:
Now, God save thy life!

BIRON:
I cannot stay thanksgiving.

DUMAIN:
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET:
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN:
A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.

BOYET:
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

BOYET:
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

BOYET:
Her mother's, I have heard.

BOYET:
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.

BOYET:
Not unlike, sir, that may be.

BIRON:
What's her name in the cap?

BOYET:
Rosaline, by good hap.

BIRON:
Is she wedded or no?

BOYET:
To her will, sir, or so.

BIRON:
You are welcome, sir: adieu.

BOYET:
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

BOYET:
And every jest but a word.

BOYET:
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

BOYET:
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

BOYET:
So you grant pasture for me.

BOYET:
Belonging to whom?

BOYET:
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

BOYET:
With that which we lovers entitle affected.

BOYET:
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

BOYET:
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

BOYET:
Do you hear, my mad wenches?

BOYET:
What then, do you see?

BOYET:
You are too hard for me.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How meanest thou? brawling in French?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How hast thou purchased this experience?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But O,--but O,--

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Almost I had.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By heart and in heart, boy.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What wilt thou prove?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am all these three.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The way is but short: away!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say lead is slow.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD:
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
the word l'envoy for a salve?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.

COSTARD:
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

COSTARD:
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?

COSTARD:
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD:
Till there be more matter in the shin.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD:
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.

COSTARD:
True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
bear this significant
to the country maid Jaquenetta:
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

COSTARD:
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
never buy and sell out of this word.

BIRON:
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.

COSTARD:
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
buy for a remuneration?

BIRON:
What is a remuneration?

COSTARD:
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BIRON:
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD:
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!

BIRON:
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD:
When would you have it done, sir?

BIRON:
This afternoon.

COSTARD:
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.

BIRON:
Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD:
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BIRON:
Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD:
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

BIRON:
It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

COSTARD:
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

BIRON:
And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.

BOYET:
I know not; but I think it was not he.

BOYET:
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?

BOYET:
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.

COSTARD:
God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?

COSTARD:
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?

COSTARD:
The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.

COSTARD:
I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.

BOYET:
I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

BOYET:
'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

BOYET:
I am much deceived but I remember the style.

BOYET:
This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.

COSTARD:
I told you; my lord.

COSTARD:
From my lord to my lady.

COSTARD:
From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.

BOYET:
Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

BOYET:
Ay, my continent of beauty.

BOYET:
My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!

BOYET:
And who is your deer?

BOYET:
But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

BOYET:
So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
wench, as touching the hit it.

BOYET:
An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.

COSTARD:
By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!

BOYET:
A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

COSTARD:
Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.

BOYET:
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

COSTARD:
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.

COSTARD:
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.

BOYET:
I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.

COSTARD:
By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
vulgar wit!
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
were, so fit.
Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
will swear!
And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
Sola, sola!

DULL:
'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

DULL:
I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.

DULL:
You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
weeks old as yet?

DULL:
What is Dictynna?

DULL:
'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.

DULL:
And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.

DULL:

COSTARD:
Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.

COSTARD:
Have with thee, my girl.

BIRON:
The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
with a paper: God give him grace to groan!

FERDINAND:
Ay me!

BIRON:

FERDINAND:

BIRON:
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!

BIRON:
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.

FERDINAND:
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!

BIRON:
One drunkard loves another of the name.

BIRON:
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

BIRON:
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.

BIRON:
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

BIRON:
All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

DUMAIN:
O most divine Kate!

BIRON:
O most profane coxcomb!

DUMAIN:
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

BIRON:
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

DUMAIN:
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.

BIRON:
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

DUMAIN:
As upright as the cedar.

BIRON:
Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.

DUMAIN:
As fair as day.

BIRON:
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

DUMAIN:
O that I had my wish!

FERDINAND:
And I mine too, good Lord!

BIRON:
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

DUMAIN:
I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.

BIRON:
A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

DUMAIN:
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

BIRON:
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

DUMAIN:

FERDINAND:

BIRON:
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!

FERDINAND:
Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

BIRON:
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?

FERDINAND:
Soft! whither away so fast?
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

BIRON:
I post from love: good lover, let me go.

FERDINAND:
What present hast thou there?

COSTARD:
Some certain treason.

FERDINAND:
What makes treason here?

COSTARD:
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

FERDINAND:
If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.

FERDINAND:
Biron, read it over.
Where hadst thou it?

FERDINAND:
Where hadst thou it?

COSTARD:
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

FERDINAND:
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?

BIRON:
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

DUMAIN:
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.

BIRON:

FERDINAND:
What?

BIRON:
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

DUMAIN:
Now the number is even.

BIRON:
True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?

FERDINAND:
Hence, sirs; away!

COSTARD:
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

BIRON:
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

FERDINAND:
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

BIRON:
Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?

FERDINAND:
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.

BIRON:
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

BIRON:
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.

FERDINAND:
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

BIRON:
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

DUMAIN:
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

FERDINAND:
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

DUMAIN:
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

BIRON:
Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

FERDINAND:
'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

BIRON:
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

DUMAIN:
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

BIRON:
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

DUMAIN:
O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

BIRON:
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

FERDINAND:
Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

DUMAIN:
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

DUMAIN:
Some salve for perjury.

BIRON:
'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfills the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

FERDINAND:
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

BIRON:
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.

FERDINAND:
And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.

BIRON:
First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

FERDINAND:
Away, away! no time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

BIRON:
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Chirrah!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Men of peace, well encountered.

COSTARD:
O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
for thou art not so long by the head as
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
swallowed than a flap-dragon.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!

COSTARD:
An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
ends, as they say.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
charge-house on the top of the mountain?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For the rest of the Worthies?--

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Shall I tell you a thing?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
beseech you, follow.

DULL:
Nor understood none neither, sir.

DULL:
I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

BOYET:
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

BOYET:
Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

BOYET:
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out,
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.

BOYET:
They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.

BOYET:
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

BOYET:
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.

BOYET:
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

BIRON:

BOYET:
True; out indeed.

BIRON:

BOYET:
They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

BIRON:
Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!

BOYET:
What would you with the princess?

BIRON:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

BOYET:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

BOYET:
She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

FERDINAND:
Say to her, we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET:
They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.

BOYET:
If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BIRON:
Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET:
She hears herself.

BIRON:
We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.

FERDINAND:
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

FERDINAND:
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.

FERDINAND:
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

FERDINAND:
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

FERDINAND:
But your legs should do it.

FERDINAND:
Why take we hands, then?

FERDINAND:
More measure of this measure; be not nice.

FERDINAND:
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?

FERDINAND:
That can never be.

FERDINAND:
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

FERDINAND:
I am best pleased with that.

BIRON:
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

BIRON:
Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half-a-dozen sweets.

BIRON:
One word in secret.

BIRON:
Thou grievest my gall.

BIRON:
Therefore meet.

DUMAIN:
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

DUMAIN:
Fair lady,--

DUMAIN:
Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

BOYET:
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

BIRON:
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

BOYET:
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

BOYET:
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.

BOYET:
They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

BOYET:
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

BOYET:
Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

BOYET:
Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?

BOYET:
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.

BIRON:
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

BIRON:
See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?

BIRON:
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

BIRON:
I am a fool, and full of poverty.

BIRON:
O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

BIRON:
I cannot give you less.

BIRON:
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

DUMAIN:
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.

BIRON:
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

BIRON:
Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

BIRON:
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

BIRON:
Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

BIRON:
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

BIRON:
Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET:
Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BIRON:
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, they would know
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.

BIRON:
What, are there but three?

COSTARD:
No, sir; but it is vara fine,
For every one pursents three.

BIRON:
And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD:
Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--

BIRON:
Is not nine.

COSTARD:
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BIRON:
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
by reckoning, sir.

BIRON:
How much is it?

COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.

BIRON:
Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD:
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.

BIRON:
Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD:
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
some care.

BIRON:
We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

BIRON:
A right description of our sport, my lord.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.

BIRON:
Why ask you?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

BIRON:
There is five in the first show.

BIRON:
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
and the boy:--
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--

BOYET:
You lie, you are not he.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--

BOYET:
With libbard's head on knee.

BIRON:
Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
with thee.

COSTARD:
I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--

DUMAIN:
The Great.

COSTARD:
It is, 'Great,' sir:--
Pompey surnamed the Great;
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
my foe to sweat:
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

COSTARD:
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
made a little fault in 'Great.'

BIRON:
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.

BOYET:
Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.

BIRON:
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

BOYET:
Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

BIRON:
Pompey the Great,--

COSTARD:
Your servant, and Costard.

BIRON:
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD:

DUMAIN:
A Judas!

DUMAIN:
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

BIRON:
A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

DUMAIN:
The more shame for you, Judas.

BOYET:
To make Judas hang himself.

BIRON:
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

BIRON:
Because thou hast no face.

BOYET:
A cittern-head.

DUMAIN:
The head of a bodkin.

BIRON:
A Death's face in a ring.

BOYET:
The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

DUMAIN:
The carved-bone face on a flask.

BIRON:
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN:
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BIRON:
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

BIRON:
False; we have given thee faces.

BIRON:
An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

BOYET:
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

DUMAIN:
For the latter end of his name.

BIRON:
For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

BOYET:
A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.

BIRON:
Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.

DUMAIN:
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

BOYET:
But is this Hector?

DUMAIN:
More calf, certain.

BOYET:
No; he is best endued in the small.

BIRON:
This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN:
He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
Gave Hector a gift,--

DUMAIN:
A gilt nutmeg.

BIRON:
A lemon.

DUMAIN:
No, cloven.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Peace!--
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
I am that flower,--

DUMAIN:
That mint.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

DUMAIN:
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

BOYET:

DUMAIN:

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--

COSTARD:
The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
is two months on her way.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What meanest thou?

COSTARD:
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
her belly already: tis yours.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
die.

COSTARD:
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
him.

DUMAIN:
Most rare Pompey!

BOYET:
Renowned Pompey!

BIRON:
Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
Pompey the Huge!

DUMAIN:
Hector trembles.

BIRON:
Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
on! stir them on!

DUMAIN:
Hector will challenge him.

BIRON:
Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
sup a flea.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By the north pole, I do challenge thee.

COSTARD:
I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
let me borrow my arms again.

DUMAIN:
Room for the incensed Worthies!

COSTARD:
I'll do it in my shirt.

DUMAIN:
Most resolute Pompey!

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
in my shirt.

DUMAIN:
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.

BIRON:
What reason have you for't?

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
woolward for penance.

BOYET:
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
his heart for a favour.

BIRON:
Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.

FERDINAND:
How fares your majesty?

FERDINAND:
Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.

BIRON:
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

DUMAIN:
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

BIRON:
[And what to me, my love? and what to me?

DUMAIN:
But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?

DUMAIN:
O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?

DUMAIN:
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

BIRON:
Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.

BIRON:
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

BIRON:
A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

BIRON:
Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.

BIRON:
That's too long for a play.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--

DUMAIN:
The worthy knight of Troy.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Holla! approach.
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.
When daisies pied and violets blue
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
Apollo. You that way: we this way.

BRABANTIO:
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?

BRABANTIO:
Why, wherefore ask you this?

BRABANTIO:
What, have you lost your wits?

BRABANTIO:
Not I what are you?

BRABANTIO:
The worser welcome:
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.

BRABANTIO:
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.

BRABANTIO:
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
My house is not a grange.

BRABANTIO:
What profane wretch art thou?

BRABANTIO:
Thou art a villain.

BRABANTIO:
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

BRABANTIO:
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream:
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say! light!

BRABANTIO:
It is too true an evil: gone she is;
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

BRABANTIO:
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?

BRABANTIO:
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

BRABANTIO:
Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

CASSIO:
The duke does greet you, general,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.

CASSIO:
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels,
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the duke's already: you have been
hotly call'd for;
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate hath sent about three several guests
To search you out.

CASSIO:
Ancient, what makes he here?

CASSIO:
I do not understand.

CASSIO:
To who?

CASSIO:
Here comes another troop to seek for you.

BRABANTIO:
Down with him, thief!

BRABANTIO:
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunned
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.

BRABANTIO:
To prison, till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.

BRABANTIO:
How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

DUKE OF VENICE:
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit.

DUKE OF VENICE:
And mine, a hundred and forty.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
I do not so secure me in the error,
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Now, what's the business?

DUKE OF VENICE:
How say you by this change?

DUKE OF VENICE:
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

DUKE OF VENICE:
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

DUKE OF VENICE:
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman.
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

BRABANTIO:
So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Take hold on me, for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Why, what's the matter?

BRABANTIO:
My daughter! O, my daughter!

DUKE OF VENICE:
Dead?

BRABANTIO:
Ay, to me;
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.

BRABANTIO:
Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate for the state-affairs
Hath hither brought.

DUKE OF VENICE:
We are very sorry for't.

DUKE OF VENICE:

BRABANTIO:
Nothing, but this is so.

BRABANTIO:
A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
To find out practises of cunning hell,
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.

DUKE OF VENICE:
To vouch this, is no proof,
Without more wider and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Fetch Desdemona hither.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Say it, Othello.

DUKE OF VENICE:
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,
Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands.

BRABANTIO:
I pray you, hear her speak:
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA:
My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.

BRABANTIO:
God be wi' you! I have done.
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor:
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
I am glad at soul I have no other child:
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
Into your favour.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

BRABANTIO:
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

DUKE OF VENICE:
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
known to you; and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

DUKE OF VENICE:
If you please,
Be't at her father's.

BRABANTIO:
I'll not have it so.

DESDEMONA:
Nor I; I would not there reside,
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

DUKE OF VENICE:
What would You, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA:
That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honour and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Be it as you shall privately determine,
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
And speed must answer it.

DUKE OF VENICE:
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
And he shall our commission bring to you;
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.

DUKE OF VENICE:
Let it be so.
Good night to every one.
And, noble signior,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

BRABANTIO:
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

CASSIO:
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements,
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

CASSIO:
His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
Stand in bold cure.

CASSIO:
What noise?

CASSIO:
My hopes do shape him for the governor.

CASSIO:
I pray you, sir, go forth,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

CASSIO:
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.
How now! who has put in?

CASSIO:
Has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona.

CASSIO:
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort!
O, behold,
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA:
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO:
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

DESDEMONA:
O, but I fear--How lost you company?

CASSIO:
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

CASSIO:
See for the news.
Good ancient, you are welcome.
Welcome, mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, she has no speech.

EMILIA:
You have little cause to say so.

DESDEMONA:
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

EMILIA:
You shall not write my praise.

DESDEMONA:
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
praise me?

DESDEMONA:
Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

DESDEMONA:
I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

DESDEMONA:
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

DESDEMONA:
Worse and worse.

EMILIA:
How if fair and foolish?

DESDEMONA:
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
her that's foul and foolish?

DESDEMONA:
O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

DESDEMONA:
To do what?

DESDEMONA:
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor?

CASSIO:
He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar.

CASSIO:
'Tis truly so.

DESDEMONA:
Let's meet him and receive him.

CASSIO:
Lo, where he comes!

DESDEMONA:
My dear Othello!

DESDEMONA:
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!

CASSIO:
Iago hath direction what to do;
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to't.

CASSIO:
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

CASSIO:
She's a most exquisite lady.

CASSIO:
Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

CASSIO:
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

CASSIO:
She is indeed perfection.

CASSIO:
Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.

CASSIO:
I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
and dare not task my weakness with any more.

CASSIO:
Where are they?

CASSIO:
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

CASSIO:
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

CASSIO:
'Fore God, an excellent song.

CASSIO:
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

CASSIO:
To the health of our general!

CASSIO:
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

CASSIO:
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

CASSIO:
For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.

CASSIO:
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
speak well enough.

All:
Excellent well.

CASSIO:
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

CASSIO:
You rogue! you rascal!

CASSIO:
A knave teach me my duty!
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

CASSIO:
Dost thou prate, rogue?

CASSIO:
Let me go, sir,
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

CASSIO:
Drunk!

CASSIO:
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

DESDEMONA:
What's the matter?

CASSIO:
Ay, past all surgery.

CASSIO:
Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!

CASSIO:
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
let us call thee devil!

CASSIO:
I know not.

CASSIO:
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

CASSIO:
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another, to make me frankly despise myself.

CASSIO:
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

CASSIO:
I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

CASSIO:
You advise me well.

CASSIO:
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

CASSIO:
Good night, honest Iago.

CASSIO:
Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'

Clown:
Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
that they speak i' the nose thus?

Clown:
Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

Clown:
O, thereby hangs a tail.

Clown:
Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
sake, to make no more noise with it.

Clown:
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
again: but, as they say to hear music the general
does not greatly care.

Clown:
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
go; vanish into air; away!

CASSIO:
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

Clown:
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

CASSIO:
Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this?

Clown:
She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
shall seem to notify unto her.

CASSIO:
Do, good my friend.
In happy time, Iago.

CASSIO:
Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.

CASSIO:
I humbly thank you for't.
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.

EMILIA:
Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.

CASSIO:
Yet, I beseech you,
If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.

EMILIA:
Pray you, come in;
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.

CASSIO:
I am much bound to you.

DESDEMONA:
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.

EMILIA:
Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
As if the case were his.

DESDEMONA:
O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

CASSIO:
Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

DESDEMONA:
I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.

CASSIO:
Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

DESDEMONA:
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

EMILIA:
Madam, here comes my lord.

CASSIO:
Madam, I'll take my leave.

DESDEMONA:
Why, stay, and hear me speak.

CASSIO:
Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
Unfit for mine own purposes.

DESDEMONA:
Well, do your discretion.

DESDEMONA:
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

DESDEMONA:
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

DESDEMONA:
Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

DESDEMONA:
But shall't be shortly?

DESDEMONA:
Shall't be to-night at supper?

DESDEMONA:
To-morrow dinner, then?

DESDEMONA:
Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

DESDEMONA:
Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.

DESDEMONA:
Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

DESDEMONA:
Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

DESDEMONA:
How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

DESDEMONA:
'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

DESDEMONA:
I am very sorry that you are not well.

EMILIA:
I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

EMILIA:
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

EMILIA:
Ha!

EMILIA:
O, is that all? What will you give me now
For the same handkerchief?

EMILIA:
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
That which so often you did bid me steal.

EMILIA:
No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
Look, here it is.

EMILIA:
What will you do with 't, that you have been
so earnest
To have me filch it?

EMILIA:
If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

DESDEMONA:
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

Clown:
I dare not say he lies any where.

DESDEMONA:
Why, man?

Clown:
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
is stabbing.

DESDEMONA:
Go to: where lodges he?

Clown:
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA:
Can any thing be made of this?

Clown:
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
to lie in mine own throat.

DESDEMONA:
Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Clown:
I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
questions, and by them answer.

DESDEMONA:
Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

Clown:
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it.

DESDEMONA:
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA:
I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA:
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA:
Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA:
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.

EMILIA:
Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA:
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
How is't with you, my lord

DESDEMONA:
Well, my good lord.

DESDEMONA:
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

DESDEMONA:
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

DESDEMONA:
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

DESDEMONA:
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

DESDEMONA:
Here, my lord.

DESDEMONA:
I have it not about me.

DESDEMONA:
No, indeed, my lord.

DESDEMONA:
Is't possible?

DESDEMONA:
Indeed! is't true?

DESDEMONA:
Then would to God that I had never seen't!

DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

DESDEMONA:
Heaven bless us!

DESDEMONA:
It is not lost; but what an if it were?

DESDEMONA:
I say, it is not lost.

DESDEMONA:
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

DESDEMONA:
Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

DESDEMONA:
I pray, talk me of Cassio.

DESDEMONA:
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you,--

DESDEMONA:
In sooth, you are to blame.

EMILIA:
Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA:
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA:
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

DESDEMONA:
How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

CASSIO:
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

EMILIA:
He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

DESDEMONA:
I prithee, do so.
Something, sure, of state,
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.

EMILIA:
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

DESDEMONA:
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

EMILIA:
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

DESDEMONA:
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA:
Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA:
I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

CASSIO:
I humbly thank your ladyship.

BIANCA:
Save you, friend Cassio!

CASSIO:
What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

BIANCA:
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!

CASSIO:
Pardon me, Bianca:
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
But I shall, in a more continuate time,
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
Take me this work out.

BIANCA:
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend:
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO:
Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, Bianca.

BIANCA:
Why, whose is it?

CASSIO:
I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

BIANCA:
Leave you! wherefore?

CASSIO:
I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

BIANCA:
Why, I pray you?

CASSIO:
Not that I love you not.

BIANCA:
But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.

CASSIO:
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

BIANCA:
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

CASSIO:
What's the matter?

CASSIO:
Rub him about the temples.

CASSIO:
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.

CASSIO:
Alas, poor caitiff!

CASSIO:
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

CASSIO:
Ha, ha, ha!

CASSIO:
I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!

CASSIO:
Prithee, say true.

CASSIO:
This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
flattery, not out of my promise.

CASSIO:
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

CASSIO:
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

CASSIO:
Well, I must leave her company.

CASSIO:
'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA:
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

CASSIO:
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

BIANCA:
An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
will not, come when you are next prepared for.

CASSIO:
'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

CASSIO:
'Faith, I intend so.

CASSIO:
Prithee, come; will you?

DESDEMONA:
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

DESDEMONA:
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

DESDEMONA:
A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

DESDEMONA:
What, is he angry?

DESDEMONA:
Trust me, I am glad on't.

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

DESDEMONA:
Why, sweet Othello,--

DESDEMONA:
I have not deserved this.

DESDEMONA:
I will not stay to offend you.

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

EMILIA:
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

EMILIA:
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

EMILIA:
Never, my lord.

EMILIA:
Never.

EMILIA:
Never, my lord.

EMILIA:
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

DESDEMONA:
My lord, what is your will?

DESDEMONA:
What is your pleasure?

DESDEMONA:
What horrible fancy's this?

DESDEMONA:
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words.
But not the words.

DESDEMONA:
Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.

DESDEMONA:
Heaven doth truly know it.

DESDEMONA:
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

DESDEMONA:
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

DESDEMONA:
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

DESDEMONA:
By heaven, you do me wrong.

DESDEMONA:
No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

DESDEMONA:
No, as I shall be saved.

DESDEMONA:
O, heaven forgive us!

EMILIA:
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA:
'Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA:
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA:
With who?

EMILIA:
Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA:
Who is thy lord?

EMILIA:
He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA:
I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA:
Here's a change indeed!

DESDEMONA:
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

DESDEMONA:
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

EMILIA:
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA:
Am I that name, Iago?

DESDEMONA:
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA:
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

DESDEMONA:
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

EMILIA:
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA:
It is my wretched fortune.

DESDEMONA:
Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA:
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

DESDEMONA:
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA:
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

EMILIA:
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

DESDEMONA:
O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

DESDEMONA:
If 'twere no other--

DESDEMONA:
Your honour is most welcome.

DESDEMONA:
My lord?

DESDEMONA:
I will, my lord.

EMILIA:
How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

DESDEMONA:
He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.

EMILIA:
Dismiss me!

DESDEMONA:
It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
We must not now displease him.

EMILIA:
I would you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA:
So would not I my love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

EMILIA:
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

DESDEMONA:
All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
In one of those same sheets.

EMILIA:
Come, come you talk.

DESDEMONA:
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it: that song to-night
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
But to go hang my head all at one side,
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

EMILIA:
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA:
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.

EMILIA:
A very handsome man.

DESDEMONA:
He speaks well.

EMILIA:
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA:

EMILIA:
It's the wind.

DESDEMONA:

EMILIA:
'Tis neither here nor there.

DESDEMONA:
I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?

EMILIA:
There be some such, no question.

DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA:
Why, would not you?

DESDEMONA:
No, by this heavenly light!

EMILIA:
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.

DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA:
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
For a small vice.

DESDEMONA:
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

EMILIA:
In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

DESDEMONA:
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

EMILIA:
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
own world, and you might quickly make it right.

DESDEMONA:
I do not think there is any such woman.

EMILIA:
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

DESDEMONA:
Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

CASSIO:
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st
I will make proof of thine.

CASSIO:
I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

CASSIO:
O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

CASSIO:
What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

CASSIO:
O, help!

CASSIO:
Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

CASSIO:
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.

CASSIO:
I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.

CASSIO:
That's one of them.

CASSIO:
My leg is cut in two.

BIANCA:
What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

BIANCA:
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
Cassio, Cassio!

CASSIO:
No.

BIANCA:
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

CASSIO:
None in the world; nor do I know the man.

EMILIA:
'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

EMILIA:
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

BIANCA:
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

EMILIA:
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

BIANCA:
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.

EMILIA:
As I! foh! fie upon thee!

DESDEMONA:
Who's there? Othello?

DESDEMONA:
Will you come to bed, my lord?

DESDEMONA:
Ay, my lord.

DESDEMONA:
Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

DESDEMONA:
Talk you of killing?

DESDEMONA:
Then heaven
Have mercy on me!

DESDEMONA:
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

DESDEMONA:
And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

DESDEMONA:
They are loves I bear to you.

DESDEMONA:
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

DESDEMONA:
I will so. What's the matter?

DESDEMONA:
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

DESDEMONA:
Ay, but not yet to die.

DESDEMONA:
Then Lord have mercy on me!

DESDEMONA:
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love: I never gave him token.

DESDEMONA:
He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

DESDEMONA:
What, my lord?

DESDEMONA:
How? unlawfully?

DESDEMONA:
He will not say so.

DESDEMONA:
O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

DESDEMONA:
Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

DESDEMONA:
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

DESDEMONA:
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

DESDEMONA:
But half an hour!

DESDEMONA:
But while I say one prayer!

EMILIA:

EMILIA:

EMILIA:

EMILIA:

EMILIA:
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

EMILIA:
But now, my lord.

EMILIA:
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.

EMILIA:
No, Cassio is not kill'd.

DESDEMONA:
O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

EMILIA:
Alas, what cry is that?

EMILIA:
Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA:
A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA:
O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA:
Nobody; I myself. Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

EMILIA:
Alas, who knows?

EMILIA:
She said so: I must needs report the truth.

EMILIA:
O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!

EMILIA:
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

EMILIA:
Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

EMILIA:
My husband!

EMILIA:
That she was false to wedlock?

EMILIA:
My husband!

EMILIA:
My husband!

EMILIA:
O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
My husband say that she was false!

EMILIA:
If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

EMILIA:
Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.

EMILIA:
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

EMILIA:
O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

EMILIA:
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
Speak, for my heart is full.

EMILIA:
But did you ever tell him she was false?

EMILIA:
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

EMILIA:
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

All:
O heavens forfend!

EMILIA:
And your reports have set the murder on.

EMILIA:
Villany, villany, villany!
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
O villany, villany!

EMILIA:
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

EMILIA:
Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye.

EMILIA:
O heaven! O heavenly powers!

EMILIA:
'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

EMILIA:
I will not.

EMILIA:
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often, with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.

EMILIA:
She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
And I did give't my husband.

EMILIA:
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?

EMILIA:
Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

EMILIA:
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
And die in music.
Willow, willow, willow,--
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.

CASSIO:
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

CASSIO:
Most heathenish and most gross!

CASSIO:
I found it in my chamber:
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.

CASSIO:
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.

CASSIO:
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
For he was great of heart.

FALSTAFF:
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

FALSTAFF:
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
thou wilt have none,--

FALSTAFF:
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter.

FALSTAFF:
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
us that are squires of the night's body be called
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

FALSTAFF:
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin?

FALSTAFF:
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft.

FALSTAFF:
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

FALSTAFF:
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

FALSTAFF:
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
you.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

FALSTAFF:
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

FALSTAFF:
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
should speak truly, little better than one of the
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
Christendom.

FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
do not, call me villain and baffle me.

FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation.
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
a true man.

FALSTAFF:
Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
I'll hang you for going.

FALSTAFF:
Hal, wilt thou make one?

FALSTAFF:
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

FALSTAFF:
Why, that's well said.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.

FALSTAFF:
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed, that the
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Peace, cousin, say no more:
And now I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
He apprehends a world of figures here,
But not the form of what he should attend.
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners,--

EARL OF WORCESTER:
You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
Those prisoners you shall keep.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear you, cousin; a word.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
When you are better temper'd to attend.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Nay, if you have not, to it again;
We will stay your leisure.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written, be assured,
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
The archbishop.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
True; who bears hard
His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
I speak not this in estimation,
As what I think might be, but what I know
Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And so they shall.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
To save our heads by raising of a head;
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
The king will always think him in our debt,
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

Chamberlain:

Chamberlain:
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
they will away presently.

Chamberlain:
No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
as truly as a man of falsehood may.

Chamberlain:
What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
out water in foul way?

Chamberlain:
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.

Chamberlain:
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.

FALSTAFF:
Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!

FALSTAFF:
Where's Poins, Hal?

FALSTAFF:
I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

FALSTAFF:
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

FALSTAFF:
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
good king's son.

FALSTAFF:
Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

FALSTAFF:
So I do, against my will.

BARDOLPH:
Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
to the king's exchequer.

FALSTAFF:
You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.

FALSTAFF:
To be hanged.

FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, will they not rob us?

FALSTAFF:
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
but yet no coward, Hal.

FALSTAFF:
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

FALSTAFF:
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
every man to his business.

FALSTAFF:
Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.

FALSTAFF:
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.

FALSTAFF:
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

FALSTAFF:
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?

FALSTAFF:
You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
shotten herring. There live not three good men
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.

FALSTAFF:
A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!

FALSTAFF:
Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?

FALSTAFF:
I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
back: call you that backing of your friends? A
plague upon such backing! give me them that will
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
drunk to-day.

FALSTAFF:
All's one for that.
A plague of all cowards, still say I.

FALSTAFF:
What's the matter! there be four of us here have
ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.

FALSTAFF:
Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
poor four of us.

FALSTAFF:
I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
through and through; my sword hacked like a
hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.

FALSTAFF:
Sixteen at least, my lord.

FALSTAFF:
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

FALSTAFF:
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.

FALSTAFF:
All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.

FALSTAFF:
Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--

FALSTAFF:
Four, Hal; I told thee four.

FALSTAFF:
These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
points in my target, thus.

FALSTAFF:
In buckram?

FALSTAFF:
Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear me, Hal?

FALSTAFF:
Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
in buckram that I told thee of--

FALSTAFF:
Their points being broken,--

FALSTAFF:
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
the eleven I paid.

FALSTAFF:
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
not see thy hand.

FALSTAFF:
What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
the truth?

FALSTAFF:
What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
compulsion, I.

FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
for breath to utter what is like thee! you
tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
standing-tuck,--

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
merry? shall we have a play extempore?

FALSTAFF:
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

FALSTAFF:
What manner of man is he?

FALSTAFF:
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
I give him his answer?

FALSTAFF:
'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

BARDOLPH:
'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

BARDOLPH:
Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices.

BARDOLPH:
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
these exhalations?

BARDOLPH:
What think you they portend?

BARDOLPH:
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

FALSTAFF:
My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
hook--what a plague call you him?

FALSTAFF:
Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
perpendicular,--

FALSTAFF:
You have hit it.

FALSTAFF:
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.

FALSTAFF:
O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.

FALSTAFF:
I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.

FALSTAFF:
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
it?

FALSTAFF:
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.

FALSTAFF:
Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

FALSTAFF:
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
in King Cambyses' vein.

FALSTAFF:
And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.

FALSTAFF:
Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.

FALSTAFF:
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

FALSTAFF:
Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

FALSTAFF:
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
thou been this month?

FALSTAFF:
Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.

FALSTAFF:
And here I stand: judge, my masters.

FALSTAFF:
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
ye for a young prince, i' faith.

FALSTAFF:
I would your grace would take me with you: whom
means your grace?

FALSTAFF:
My lord, the man I know.

FALSTAFF:
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

BARDOLPH:
O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
monstrous watch is at the door.

FALSTAFF:
Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
without seeming so.

FALSTAFF:
I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.

FALSTAFF:
Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
therefore I'll hide me.

Carrier:
As fat as butter.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite beside his patience.
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
Defect of manners, want of government,
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
Beguiling them of commendation.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
spoil of me.

BARDOLPH:
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.

FALSTAFF:
Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
of all compass.

BARDOLPH:
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
compass, Sir John.

FALSTAFF:
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
Knight of the Burning Lamp.

BARDOLPH:
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

FALSTAFF:
No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
for the light in thy face, the son of utter
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
it!

BARDOLPH:
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

FALSTAFF:
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
yet who picked my pocket?

FALSTAFF:
Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
to, you are a woman, go.

FALSTAFF:
Go to, I know you well enough.

FALSTAFF:
Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.

FALSTAFF:
He had his part of it; let him pay.

FALSTAFF:
How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.

FALSTAFF:
How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
would say so.
How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
must we all march?

BARDOLPH:
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

FALSTAFF:
Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.

FALSTAFF:
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
bawdy-house; they pick pockets.

FALSTAFF:
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
grandfather's.

FALSTAFF:
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
go

FALSTAFF:
What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.

FALSTAFF:
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
otherwise.

FALSTAFF:
What beast! why, an otter.

FALSTAFF:
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
where to have her.

FALSTAFF:
A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
a million: thou owest me thy love.

FALSTAFF:
Did I, Bardolph?

BARDOLPH:
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

FALSTAFF:
Yea, if he said my ring was copper.

FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
roaring of a lion's whelp.

FALSTAFF:
The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
I do, I pray God my girdle break.

FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?

FALSTAFF:
Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
prithee, be gone.
Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
lad, how is that answered?

FALSTAFF:
O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.

FALSTAFF:
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
do it with unwashed hands too.

BARDOLPH:
Do, my lord.

FALSTAFF:
I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
laud them, I praise them.

BARDOLPH:
My lord?

FALSTAFF:
Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Thou art the king of honour:
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited:
His health was never better worth than now.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
'Faith, and so we should;
Where now remains a sweet reversion:
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
Is to come in:
A comfort of retirement lives in this.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
But yet I would your father had been here.
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division: it will be thought
By some, that know not why he is away,
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction
And breed a kind of question in our cause;
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
As heart can think: there is not such a word
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.

BARDOLPH:
Will you give me money, captain?

FALSTAFF:
Lay out, lay out.

BARDOLPH:
This bottle makes an angel.

FALSTAFF:
An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.

BARDOLPH:
I will, captain: farewell.

FALSTAFF:
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
their services; and now my whole charge consists of
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

FALSTAFF:
What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
at Shrewsbury.

FALSTAFF:
Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
steal cream.

FALSTAFF:
Mine, Hal, mine.

FALSTAFF:
Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.

FALSTAFF:
'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
learned that of me.

FALSTAFF:
What, is the king encamped?

FALSTAFF:
Well,
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
It may not be.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You give him then the advantage.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You do not counsel well:
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Yea, or to-night.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The number of the king exceedeth ours:
For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
With winged haste to the lord marshal;
This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
To whom they are directed. If you knew
How much they do to import, you would make haste.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Like enough you do.
To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
As I am truly given to understand,
The king with mighty and quick-raised power
Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
What with the sickness of Northumberland,
Whose power was in the first proportion,
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
Who with them was a rated sinew too
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the king.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
No, Mortimer is not there.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
The special head of all the land together:
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
And moe corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
For he hath heard of our confederacy,
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
Therefore make haste. I must go write again
To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear me, my liege:
For mine own part, I could be well content
To entertain the lag-end of my life
With quiet hours; for I do protest,
I have not sought the day of this dislike.

FALSTAFF:
Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our house;
And yet I must remember you, my lord,
We were the first and dearest of your friends.
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richard's time; and posted day and night
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
It was myself, my brother and his son,
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
To this we swore our aid. But in short space
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
What with our help, what with the absent king,
What with the injuries of a wanton time,
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
And the contrarious winds that held the king
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead:
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
To gripe the general sway into your hand;
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
Out of sight and raise this present head;
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.

FALSTAFF:
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.

FALSTAFF:
I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.

FALSTAFF:
'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
his day. What need I be so forward with him that
calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
ends my catechism.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
The liberal and kind offer of the king.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then are we all undone.
It is not possible, it cannot be,
The king should keep his word in loving us;
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults:
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
For treason is but trusted like the fox,
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
Interpretation will misquote our looks,
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
And an adopted name of privilege,
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
All his offences live upon my head
And on his father's; we did train him on,
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
In any case, the offer of the king.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The king will bid you battle presently.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
There is no seeming mercy in the king.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
I told him gently of our grievances,
Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Know then, my name is Douglas;
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Here.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
Until I meet the king.

FALSTAFF:
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
But who comes here?

FALSTAFF:
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.

FALSTAFF:
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.

FALSTAFF:
Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.

FALSTAFF:
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
unlooked for, and there's an end.

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
That counterfeit'st the person of a king?

EARL OF DOUGLAS:
I fear thou art another counterfeit;
And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
And thus I win thee.

FALSTAFF:
Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
boy's play here, I can tell you.

FALSTAFF:

FALSTAFF:
No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
earl or duke, I can assure you.

FALSTAFF:
Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.

FALSTAFF:
I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

EARL OF WORCESTER:
What I have done my safety urged me to;
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.

BERNARDO:
Who's there?

BERNARDO:
Long live the king!

BERNARDO:
He.

BERNARDO:
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

BERNARDO:
Have you had quiet guard?

BERNARDO:
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

BERNARDO:
Say,
What, is Horatio there?

BERNARDO:
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

BERNARDO:
I have seen nothing.

BERNARDO:
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.

BERNARDO:
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--

BERNARDO:
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

BERNARDO:
Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.

BERNARDO:
It would be spoke to.

BERNARDO:
See, it stalks away!

BERNARDO:
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?

BERNARDO:
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.

BERNARDO:
'Tis here!

BERNARDO:
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

CORNELIUS:
In that and all things will we show our duty.

All:
Our duty to your honour.

All:
Lights, lights, lights!

Captain:
I will do't, my lord.

Captain:
They are of Norway, sir.

Captain:
Against some part of Poland.

Captain:
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

Captain:
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

Captain:
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

Captain:
God be wi' you, sir.

Danes:
No, let's come in.

Danes:
We will, we will.

Danes:

All:
Gentlemen,--

All:
Treason! treason!

FALSTAFF:
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

FALSTAFF:
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?

FALSTAFF:
I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
That is now answered.

FALSTAFF:
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
you'll be laughed at.

FALSTAFF:
Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
head: what matter have you against me?

BARDOLPH:
You Banbury cheese!

FALSTAFF:
Pistol!

FALSTAFF:
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

FALSTAFF:
Is this true, Pistol?

FALSTAFF:
What say you, Scarlet and John?

BARDOLPH:
Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
himself out of his five sentences.

BARDOLPH:
And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
so conclusions passed the careires.

FALSTAFF:
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
by your leave, good mistress.

ANNE PAGE:
The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.

ANNE PAGE:
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

ANNE PAGE:
The dinner attends you, sir.

ANNE PAGE:
I may not go in without your worship: they will not
sit till you come.

ANNE PAGE:
I pray you, sir, walk in.

ANNE PAGE:
I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

ANNE PAGE:
Ay, indeed, sir.

ANNE PAGE:
Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

FALSTAFF:
Mine host of the Garter!

FALSTAFF:
Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.

FALSTAFF:
I sit at ten pounds a week.

FALSTAFF:
Do so, good mine host.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.

BARDOLPH:
It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.

FALSTAFF:
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an
unskilful singer; he kept not time.

FALSTAFF:
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

FALSTAFF:
There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.

FALSTAFF:
Which of you know Ford of this town?

FALSTAFF:
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

FALSTAFF:
No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

FALSTAFF:
Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.

FALSTAFF:
I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.

FALSTAFF:
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

FALSTAFF:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
is dat knave Rugby?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!
Rugby, my rapier!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Wherefore shall I be content-a?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
no honest man dat shall come in my closet.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vell.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
Tarry you a little-a while.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
at his dog:

DOCTOR CAIUS:
It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
will myself have Anne Page.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
door. Follow my heels, Rugby.

FENTON:

FENTON:
How now, good woman? how dost thou?

FENTON:
What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

FENTON:
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?

FENTON:
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

FENTON:
Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
thou seest her before me, commend me.

FENTON:
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

FALSTAFF:
I will not lend thee a penny.

FALSTAFF:
Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
good friends for three reprieves for you and your
coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
mine honour thou hadst it not.

FALSTAFF:
Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
honour! You will not do it, you!

FALSTAFF:
Let her approach.

FALSTAFF:
Good morrow, good wife.

FALSTAFF:
Good maid, then.

FALSTAFF:
I do believe the swearer. What with me?

FALSTAFF:
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
the hearing.

FALSTAFF:
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--

FALSTAFF:
I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
own people.

FALSTAFF:
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--

FALSTAFF:
But what says she to me? be brief, my good
she-Mercury.

FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven?

FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
not fail her.

FALSTAFF:
Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
good parts aside I have no other charms.

FALSTAFF:
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?

FALSTAFF:
Why, I will.

FALSTAFF:
Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
this woman.
This news distracts me!

FALSTAFF:
Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
fairly done, no matter.

BARDOLPH:
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.

FALSTAFF:
Brook is his name?

BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Call him in.
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
have I encompassed you? go to; via!

FALSTAFF:
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?

FALSTAFF:
You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.

FALSTAFF:
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.

FALSTAFF:
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.

FALSTAFF:
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.

FALSTAFF:
Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
your servant.

FALSTAFF:
Very well, sir; proceed.

FALSTAFF:
Well, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?

FALSTAFF:
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

FALSTAFF:
Of what quality was your love, then?

FALSTAFF:
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

FALSTAFF:
O, sir!

FALSTAFF:
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.

FALSTAFF:
I say you shall.

FALSTAFF:
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
know how I speed.

FALSTAFF:
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
and there's my harvest-home.

FALSTAFF:
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Jack Rugby!

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat is de clock, Jack?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, he has save his soul, dat he is no come; he
has pray his Pible well, dat he is no come: by gar,
Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he be come.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him.
Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Villany, take your rapier.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de vorld; he
is not show his face.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I pray you, bear vitness that me have stay six or
seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Mock-vater! vat is dat?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, den, I have as mush mock-vater as de
Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog priest! by gar, me
vill cut his ears.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Clapper-de-claw! vat is dat?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me;
for, by gar, me vill have it.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Me tank you for dat.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a
jack-an-ape to Anne Page.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, me dank you for dat: by gar, I love you;
and I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl,
de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis good; vell said.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I
not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place
I did appoint?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, dat is very good; excellent.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of
us, ha, ha?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
Quickly tell me so mush.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

All:
Have with you to see this monster.

FALSTAFF:
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
best lord; I would make thee my lady.

FALSTAFF:
Let the court of France show me such another. I see
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
Venetian admittance.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.

FALSTAFF:
What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
but thee; and thou deservest it.

FALSTAFF:
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
of a lime-kiln.

FALSTAFF:
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.

FALSTAFF:
She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.

FALSTAFF:

FALSTAFF:
I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
I'll never--

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
jealous in France.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!

FENTON:
I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

ANNE PAGE:
Alas, how then?

FENTON:
Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth--,
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

ANNE PAGE:
May be he tells you true.

FENTON:
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

ANNE PAGE:
Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!

ANNE PAGE:
I come to him.
This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

ANNE PAGE:
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

ANNE PAGE:
Now, Master Slender,--

ANNE PAGE:
What is your will?

ANNE PAGE:
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?

FENTON:
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

FENTON:
Sir, will you hear me?

FENTON:
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.

ANNE PAGE:
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

ANNE PAGE:
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
And bowl'd to death with turnips!

FENTON:
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

FENTON:
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, I say,--

BARDOLPH:
Here, sir.

FALSTAFF:
Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.

BARDOLPH:
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.

FALSTAFF:
Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
pills to cool the reins. Call her in.

BARDOLPH:
Come in, woman!

FALSTAFF:
Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
sack finely.

BARDOLPH:
With eggs, sir?

FALSTAFF:
Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
How now!

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.

FALSTAFF:
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

FALSTAFF:
Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
and then judge of my merit.

FALSTAFF:
Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

FALSTAFF:
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

FALSTAFF:
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.

FALSTAFF:
Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
between me and Ford's wife?

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
house the hour she appointed me.

FALSTAFF:
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

FALSTAFF:
No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.

FALSTAFF:
While I was there.

FALSTAFF:
You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.

FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.

FALSTAFF:
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.

FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.

FALSTAFF:
Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
cuckold Ford.

FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
sure of your husband now?

FALSTAFF:
No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
out ere he come?

FALSTAFF:
What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.

FALSTAFF:
Where is it?

FALSTAFF:
I'll go out then.

FALSTAFF:
Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
than a mischief.

BARDOLPH:
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.

BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

FALSTAFF:

FALSTAFF:
There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
me; but she's gone.

FALSTAFF:
Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?

FALSTAFF:
I spake with the old woman about it.

FALSTAFF:
Marry, she says that the very same man that
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
it.

FALSTAFF:
What are they? let us know.

FALSTAFF:
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

FALSTAFF:
To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.

FALSTAFF:
Ay, sir; like who more bold.

FALSTAFF:
Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
my learning.

BARDOLPH:
Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!

BARDOLPH:
Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.

FALSTAFF:
I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
Now, whence come you?

FALSTAFF:
The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
of man's disposition is able to bear.

FALSTAFF:
What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.

FALSTAFF:
Come up into my chamber.

FENTON:
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

FENTON:
From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

FENTON:
Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.

FENTON:
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

FALSTAFF:
Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

FALSTAFF:
Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
see wonders.

FALSTAFF:
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

FALSTAFF:
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
doe?

FALSTAFF:
My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.

FALSTAFF:
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!

FALSTAFF:
What should this be?

FALSTAFF:
I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
never else cross me thus.

FALSTAFF:
They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

FALSTAFF:
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese!

FALSTAFF:
Oh, Oh, Oh!

FALSTAFF:
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

FALSTAFF:
And these are not fairies? I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
ill employment!

FALSTAFF:
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.

FALSTAFF:
'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.

FALSTAFF:
Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
me as you will.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

ANNE PAGE:
Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

FENTON:
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

FALSTAFF:
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.

FALSTAFF:
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.

AEGEON:
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
If any born at Ephesus be seen
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again: if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

AEGEON:
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.

AEGEON:
A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long, but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
And by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

AEGEON:
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

DUKE SOLINUS:
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

AEGEON:
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother: and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death,
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honour's great disparagement,
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

AEGEON:
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

ADRIANA:
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

ADRIANA:
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

ADRIANA:
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

ADRIANA:
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

ADRIANA:
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

ADRIANA:
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

ADRIANA:
How if your husband start some other where?

ADRIANA:
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
As much or more would we ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

ADRIANA:
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
can witness.

ADRIANA:
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them.

ADRIANA:
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA:
Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Quoth my master:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA:
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA:
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And he will bless that cross with other beating:
Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA:
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

ADRIANA:
His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

ADRIANA:
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
a wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
For two; and sound ones too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sure ones, then.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Certain ones then.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
lost by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
to the world's end will have bald followers.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

ADRIANA:
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled that same drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Want wit in all one word to understand.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By me?

ADRIANA:
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I never spake with her in all my life.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
How can she thus then call us by our names,
Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA:
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am transformed, master, am I not?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou hast thine own form.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, I am an ape.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA:
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I'll say as they say and persever so,
And in this mist at all adventures go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

ADRIANA:
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

BALTHAZAR:
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
welcome dear.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

BALTHAZAR:
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

BALTHAZAR:
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
the street.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
name for an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Let my master in, Luce.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O Lord, I must laugh!
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou baggage, let me in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, knock the door hard.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

ADRIANA:

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

ADRIANA:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

ANGELO:
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
fain have either.

BALTHAZAR:
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
let me in.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

BALTHAZAR:
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.
Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ANGELO:
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thy sister's sister.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
No;
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
am I myself?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What claim lays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What complexion is she of?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
That's a fault that water will mend.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What's her name?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
hip to hip.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Then she bears some breadth?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
countries in her.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where Scotland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where France?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
against her heir.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where England?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where Spain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where America, the Indies?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
faith and my heart of steel,
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
me turn i' the wheel.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbour in this town to-night:
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us and we know none,
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
As from a bear a man would run for life,
So fly I from her that would be my wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
There's none but witches do inhabit here;
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

ANGELO:
Master Antipholus,--

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, that's my name.

ANGELO:
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What is your will that I shall do with this?

ANGELO:
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

ANGELO:
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
And then receive my money for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

ANGELO:
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
If any ship put out, then straight away.

ANGELO:
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus,
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates,
For locking me out of my doors by day.
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
I promised your presence and the chain;
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long,
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

ANGELO:
Saving your merry humour, here's the note
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
I pray you, see him presently discharged,
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I am not furnish'd with the present money;
Besides, I have some business in the town.
Good signior, take the stranger to my house
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

ANGELO:
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

ANGELO:
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
Or else you may return without your money.

ANGELO:
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

ANGELO:
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

ANGELO:
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
Either send the chain or send me by some token.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I answer you! what should I answer you?

ANGELO:
The money that you owe me for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I owe you none till I receive the chain.

ANGELO:
You know I gave it you half an hour since.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

ANGELO:
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
Consider how it stands upon my credit.

ANGELO:
This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

ANGELO:
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
I would not spare my brother in this case,
If he should scorn me so apparently.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
As all the metal in your shop will answer.

ANGELO:
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
And told thee to what purpose and what end.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I will debate this matter at more leisure
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
Tell her I am arrested in the street
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
On, officer, to prison till it come.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
To Adriana! that is where we dined,
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
Thither I must, although against my will,
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

ADRIANA:
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

ADRIANA:
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

ADRIANA:
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

ADRIANA:
And what said he?

ADRIANA:
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

ADRIANA:
Didst speak him fair?

ADRIANA:
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

ADRIANA:
Ah, but I think him better than I say,
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By running fast.

ADRIANA:
Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

ADRIANA:
Why, man, what is the matter?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

ADRIANA:
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

ADRIANA:
Go fetch it, sister.
This I wonder at,
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

ADRIANA:
What, the chain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
strikes one.

ADRIANA:
The hours come back! that did I never hear.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
very fear.

ADRIANA:
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
worth, to season.
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

ADRIANA:
Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commodities to buy:
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
forsake your liberty.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I understand thee not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morris-pike.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
What, thou meanest an officer?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
give you good rest!'

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
The fellow is distract, and so am I;
And here we wander in illusions:
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

Courtezan:
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, is this Mistress Satan?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
It is the devil.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
written, they appear to men like angels of light:
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

Courtezan:
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
long spoon.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Why, Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
the devil.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

Courtezan:
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

Courtezan:
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.

Courtezan:
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
And for the same he promised me a chain:
Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad,
Besides this present instance of his rage,
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
But where's the money?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
your blows.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
rope's-end.'

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Wilt thou still talk?

Courtezan:
How say you now? is not your husband mad?

ADRIANA:
His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.

Courtezan:
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

ADRIANA:
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house?

ADRIANA:
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And did not she herself revile me there?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And did not I in rage depart from thence?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

ADRIANA:
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

ADRIANA:
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely master, not a rag of money.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

ADRIANA:
He came to me and I deliver'd it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

ADRIANA:
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And, gentle master, I received no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

ADRIANA:
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.

ADRIANA:
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
To make a rescue?

ADRIANA:
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

ADRIANA:
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
O most unhappy strumpet!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
cry 'The devil!'

ADRIANA:
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

ADRIANA:
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

ADRIANA:
Say, how grows it due?

ADRIANA:
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

Courtezan:
When as your husband all in rage to-day
Came to my house and took away my ring--
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

ADRIANA:
It may be so, but I did never see it.
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

ADRIANA:
And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I see these witches are afraid of swords.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She that would be your wife now ran from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I will not stay to-night for all the town;
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

ANGELO:
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

ANGELO:
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

ANGELO:
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think I had; I never did deny it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

ADRIANA:
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
Some get within him, take his sword away:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

AEMELIA:
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

ADRIANA:
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery.

ANGELO:
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

AEMELIA:
How long hath this possession held the man?

ADRIANA:
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
And much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

AEMELIA:
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

ADRIANA:
To none of these, except it be the last;
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

AEMELIA:
You should for that have reprehended him.

ADRIANA:
Why, so I did.

AEMELIA:
Ay, but not rough enough.

ADRIANA:
As roughly as my modesty would let me.

AEMELIA:
Haply, in private.

ADRIANA:
And in assemblies too.

AEMELIA:
Ay, but not enough.

ADRIANA:
It was the copy of our conference:
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
At board he fed not for my urging it;
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

AEMELIA:
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
And therefore comes it that his head is light.
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

ADRIANA:
She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people enter and lay hold on him.

AEMELIA:
No, not a creature enters in my house.

ADRIANA:
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

AEMELIA:
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
Or lose my labour in assaying it.

ADRIANA:
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.

AEMELIA:
Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
To make of him a formal man again:
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

ADRIANA:
I will not hence and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.

AEMELIA:
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

ADRIANA:
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

ANGELO:
Upon what cause?

ANGELO:
See where they come: we will behold his death.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
If any friend will pay the sum for him,
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

ADRIANA:
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

DUKE SOLINUS:
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

ADRIANA:
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
At your important letters,--this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street,
With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again and madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
To do him all the grace and good I could.
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
I will determine this before I stir.

ADRIANA:
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
And that is false thou dost report to us.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!

ADRIANA:
Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
That he is borne about invisible:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

AEGEON:
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonour'd me
Even in the strength and height of injury!
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

DUKE SOLINUS:
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

ADRIANA:
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!

ANGELO:
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
My liege, I am advised what I say,
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.

ANGELO:
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

DUKE SOLINUS:
But had he such a chain of thee or no?

ANGELO:
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I never came within these abbey-walls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
And this is false you burden me withal.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

Courtezan:
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

Courtezan:
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

AEGEON:
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

AEGEON:
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

AEGEON:
I am sure you both of you remember me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

AEGEON:
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

AEGEON:
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Neither.

AEGEON:
Dromio, nor thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

AEGEON:
I am sure thou dost.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.

AEGEON:
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I never saw my father in my life.

AEGEON:
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

DUKE SOLINUS:
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

AEMELIA:
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

ADRIANA:
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

DUKE SOLINUS:
One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

AEMELIA:
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
And speak unto the same AEmilia!

AEGEON:
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

AEMELIA:
By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, here begins his morning story right;
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

DUKE SOLINUS:
Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And I with him.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

ADRIANA:
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I, gentle mistress.

ADRIANA:
And are not you my husband?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
No; I say nay to that.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother.
What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

ANGELO:
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

ANGELO:
I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

ADRIANA:
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, none by me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these errors are arose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
These ducats pawn I for my father here.

DUKE SOLINUS:
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

Courtezan:
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

AEMELIA:
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
The duke, my husband and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
After so long grief, such festivity!

DUKE SOLINUS:
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There is a fat friend at your master's house,
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not I, sir; you are my elder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That's a question: how shall we try it?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother;
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

Chorus:
O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object: can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Into a thousand parts divide on man,
And make imaginary puissance;
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Admit me Chorus to this history;
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

CANTERBURY:
My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.

ELY:
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

CANTERBURY:
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside,
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.

ELY:
This would drink deep.

CANTERBURY:
'Twould drink the cup and all.

ELY:
But what prevention?

CANTERBURY:
The king is full of grace and fair regard.

ELY:
And a true lover of the holy church.

CANTERBURY:
The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.

ELY:
We are blessed in the change.

CANTERBURY:
Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.

ELY:
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

CANTERBURY:
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.

ELY:
But, my good lord,
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
Incline to it, or no?

CANTERBURY:
He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.

ELY:
How did this offer seem received, my lord?

CANTERBURY:
With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

ELY:
What was the impediment that broke this off?

CANTERBURY:
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

ELY:
It is.

CANTERBURY:
Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

ELY:
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

EXETER:
Not here in presence.

CANTERBURY:
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!

CANTERBURY:
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

CANTERBURY:
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English. that could entertain
With half their forces the full Pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!

ELY:
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

EXETER:
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.

CANTERBURY:
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.

CANTERBURY:
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

CANTERBURY:
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.

EXETER:
It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high and low and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.

CANTERBURY:
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.

EXETER:
Tennis-balls, my liege.

EXETER:
This was a merry message.

Chorus:
Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits Expectation in the air,
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England! model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
The abuse of distance; force a play:
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
The king is set from London; and the scene
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

BARDOLPH:
Well met, Corporal Nym.

BARDOLPH:
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

BARDOLPH:
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
be so, good Corporal Nym.

BARDOLPH:
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
were troth-plight to her.

BARDOLPH:
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

BARDOLPH:
Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.

BARDOLPH:
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

Boy:
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.

BARDOLPH:
Away, you rogue!

BARDOLPH:
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
France together: why the devil should we keep
knives to cut one another's throats?

BARDOLPH:
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll
kill him; by this sword, I will.

BARDOLPH:
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:
an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
Prithee, put up.

BEDFORD:
'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.

EXETER:
They shall be apprehended by and by.

BEDFORD:
The king hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.

EXETER:
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.

CAMBRIDGE:
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government.

CAMBRIDGE:
So may your highness, and yet punish too.

CAMBRIDGE:
I one, my lord:
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

CAMBRIDGE:
I do confess my fault;
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

CAMBRIDGE:
For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended:
But God be thanked for prevention;
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.

BARDOLPH:
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
heaven or in hell!

BARDOLPH:
And of women.

Boy:
Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils
incarnate.

Boy:
A' said once, the devil would have him about women.

Boy:
Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
burning in hell-fire?

BARDOLPH:
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
that's all the riches I got in his service.

Boy:
And that's but unwholesome food they say.

BARDOLPH:
Farewell, hostess.

DAUPHIN:
My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
And let us do it with no show of fear;
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.

Constable:
O peace, Prince Dauphin!
You are too much mistaken in this king:
Question your grace the late ambassadors,
With what great state he heard their embassy,
How well supplied with noble counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution,
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.

DAUPHIN:
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
But though we think it so, it is no matter:
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak or niggardly projection
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.

DAUPHIN:
Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head:
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.

EXETER:
From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, 'long
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
He sends you this most memorable line,
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing to overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger.

EXETER:
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threatening and my message;
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

DAUPHIN:
For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him: what to him from England?

EXETER:
Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
And any thing that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordnance.

DAUPHIN:
Say, if my father render fair return,
It is against my will; for I desire
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
As matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls.

EXETER:
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
As we his subjects have in wonder found,
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
In your own losses, if he stay in France.

EXETER:
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.

Chorus:
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
Play with your fancies, and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
You stand upon the ravage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
With one appearing hair, that will not follow
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.

BARDOLPH:
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

Boy:
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.

Boy:
As duly, but not as truly,
As bird doth sing on bough.

Boy:
As young as I am, I have observed these three
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
broke any man's head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
if I should take from another's pocket to put into
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them, and seek some better service:
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
therefore I must cast it up.

ALICE:
Un peu, madame.

ALICE:
La main? elle est appelee de hand.

ALICE:
Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me
souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont
appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.

ALICE:
Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.

ALICE:
C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglois.

ALICE:
De arm, madame.

ALICE:
De elbow.

ALICE:
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.

ALICE:
De elbow, madame.

ALICE:
De neck, madame.

ALICE:
De chin.

ALICE:
Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez
les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.

ALICE:
N'avez vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?

ALICE:
De nails, madame.

ALICE:
Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

ALICE:
De foot, madame; et de coun.

ALICE:
Excellent, madame!

Constable:
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
Let us not live in France; let us quit all
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

DAUPHIN:
O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
And overlook their grafters?

BOURBON:
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
Mort de ma vie! if they march along
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

Constable:
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Poor we may call them in their native lords.

DAUPHIN:
By faith and honour,
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

BOURBON:
They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;
Saying our grace is only in our heels,
And that we are most lofty runaways.

Constable:
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
And for achievement offer us his ransom.

DAUPHIN:
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

Constable:
Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!

Constable:
It is the best horse of Europe.

DAUPHIN:
My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
talk of horse and armour?

DAUPHIN:
What a long night is this! I will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

DAUPHIN:
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
may call beasts.

Constable:
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

DAUPHIN:
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.

DAUPHIN:
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:
'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the
world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him. I
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
'Wonder of nature,'--

DAUPHIN:
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
courser, for my horse is my mistress.

DAUPHIN:
Me well; which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress.

Constable:
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back.

DAUPHIN:
So perhaps did yours.

Constable:
Mine was not bridled.

DAUPHIN:
O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,
like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
your straight strossers.

Constable:
You have good judgment in horsemanship.

DAUPHIN:
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
my horse to my mistress.

Constable:
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

DAUPHIN:
I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.

Constable:
I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
to my mistress.

DAUPHIN:
'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et
la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.

Constable:
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.

Constable:
Stars, my lord.

DAUPHIN:
Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.

Constable:
And yet my sky shall not want.

DAUPHIN:
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
'twere more honour some were away.

Constable:
Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.

DAUPHIN:
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
my way shall be paved with English faces.

Constable:
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
fain be about the ears of the English.

Constable:
You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.

DAUPHIN:
'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.

Constable:
I think he will eat all he kills.

Constable:
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

Constable:
Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

Constable:
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.

Constable:
I was told that by one that knows him better than
you.

Constable:
Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared
not who knew it

Constable:
By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
appears, it will bate.

Constable:
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'

Constable:
Well placed: there stands your friend for the
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
pox of the devil.'

Constable:
You have shot over.

Constable:
Who hath measured the ground?

Constable:
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
the dawning as we do.

Constable:
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.

Constable:
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
their wits with their wives: and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils.

Constable:
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
come, shall we about it?

Chorus:
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each other's watch:
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation:
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and over-lusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruin'd band
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night,
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

ERPINGHAM:
Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'

ERPINGHAM:
Shall I attend your grace?

ERPINGHAM:
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!

COURT:
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
breaks yonder?

BATES:
I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
the approach of day.

BATES:
He hath not told his thought to the king?

BATES:
He may show what outward courage he will; but I
believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

BATES:
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.

BATES:
Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
the crime of it out of us.

BATES:
But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

BATES:
Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.

ERPINGHAM:
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
Seek through your camp to find you.

ERPINGHAM:
I shall do't, my lord.

DAUPHIN:
Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!

DAUPHIN:
Via! les eaux et la terre.

DAUPHIN:
Ciel, cousin Orleans.
Now, my lord constable!

Constable:
Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!

DAUPHIN:
Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

Constable:
To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands;
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
Who in unnecessary action swarm
About our squares of battle, were enow
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
Though we upon this mountain's basis by
Took stand for idle speculation:
But that our honours must not. What's to say?
A very little little let us do.
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
For our approach shall so much dare the field
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

Constable:
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.

DAUPHIN:
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?

Constable:
I stay but for my guidon: to the field!
I will the banner from a trumpet take,
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.

BEDFORD:
The king himself is rode to view their battle.

EXETER:
There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.

BEDFORD:
Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!

EXETER:
Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.

BEDFORD:
He is full of valour as of kindness;
Princely in both.

Boy:
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?

Boy:
He says his name is Master Fer.

Boy:
I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.

Boy:
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous
pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette
heure de couper votre gorge.

Boy:
He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of
a good house; and for his ransom he will give you
two hundred crowns.

Boy:
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner
aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous
l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la
liberte, le franchisement.

Boy:
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and
he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into
the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.

Boy:
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
I did never know so full a voice issue from so
empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty
vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym
had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
the old play, that every one may pare his nails with
a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so
would this be, if he durst steal any thing
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with
the luggage of our camp: the French might have a
good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is
none to guard it but boys.

Constable:
O diable!

DAUPHIN:
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
Reproach and everlasting shame
Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!
Do not run away.

Constable:
Why, all our ranks are broke.

DAUPHIN:
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?

BOURBON:
Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
Let us die in honour: once more back again;
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,
Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
His fairest daughter is contaminated.

Constable:
Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

BOURBON:
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:
Let life be short; else shame will be too long.

EXETER:
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

EXETER:
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry!'
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
Commend my service to me sovereign.'
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
But I had not so much of man in me,
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.

EXETER:
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

EXETER:
Soldier, you must come to the king.

EXETER:
Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;
John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

EXETER:
'Tis wonderful!
