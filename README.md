# Federated_Learning ðŸ’»
This projest include common test models for federated learning, like CNN, Resnet18 and lstm, controlled by different parser. It can also handle common noniid data. We can change the parameters to change the model and dataset. Here is the related introduction.

## Network Models

This project contains network models commonly used in FLï¼šResnet18, CNN and LSTM.
- **Resnet18**

A ***Residual Neural Network*** (ResNet) is an artificial neural network (ANN). Typical ResNet models are implemented with double- or triple- layer skips that contain nonlinearities (ReLU) and batch normalization in between. An additional weight matrix may be used to learn the skip weights. These models are known as HighwayNets.

> Working with datasets: Cifar10, MNIST, FMNIST.

- **CNN**

In deep learning, the **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs are a specialized type of neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers.

- **LSTM**
